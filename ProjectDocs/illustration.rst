		balloon.png

			Goal: show how charges can change inside of objects. 

			This illustration shows a balloon and a wall, and the charges of particles within each object. I chose to show multiple panels to better explain the cause and effect of this experiment. I included one panel that implies motion through blur. To avoid confusion, I didn't include the charges in the middle panel, so that students will focus on the outcome rather than the exact mechanisms of how charges move.

			I created the effect of motion by duplicating the balloon twice on each side, and lowering the opacity by 10% for the closest duplicate, then 20% for the farthest.

			I used red on the balloon to catch the reader's eye. I also like the contrast of the bright red and deep blue. These colors also are differentiable in gray scale.

			Note: 

		lightning.png
			Goal: show how lightning forms

			A tree, a cloud, and a lightning bolt. The cloud is negatively charged, and charge travels down the lightning towards the positively charged tree.


			Note: I've read that lightning can move bottom to top as well. Should we go into depth, or show a simple view?
