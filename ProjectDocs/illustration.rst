Workbook 1
===========
	matter_energy_intro
		atom1.png
			Goal: Show components of an atom in a clear way
			I used Red, Blue, and Yellow for Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons. It may be smart to switch red/blue depending on standard practices for protons and neutrons in other textbooks. I used dashed lines for labels to differentiate from the lines showing electron orbits.

		massvweight.png
			Goal: Show the difference in weight and mass
			I recreated the existing graphic, replacing mars with the moon since the size difference is more apparent. I changed the position of the person on the moon so that they would appear to weigh less.




	atomic_mass
		element.png
			Goal: Show the different components of an entry in the periodic table
			Lines connect to labels. Tried to keep it consistent and balanced.


	work_energy
		workvsforce.png
			Goal: Show the difference in work and force. 
			I showed that with work, there is distance traveled and motion involved, and with force there is not necessarily motion or distance traveled. I used lines to show motion and lack of motion.

	units_conversions
		N/A

	simple_machines
		gearsNew.png
			Goal: Show how gears interact with each other, impact direction, and what their names are. 
			Used blue for the outer gears and gray for the inner gears to show the difference in direction. 

		hydraulicsNew.png
			Goal: Create an intuitive understanding of how hydraulics work
			I put the before and after side by side to better show the change in water level. I also used a lighter blue for the water to reduce ink usage. 

		rampcomparison.png
			Goal: Show the ease of a less steep ramp
			Showing a wheelchair ramp and a skateboard ramp. I used different speed lines to show that the ball goes faster up a skateboard ramp at that point than a wheelchair ramp.
			Note: there could be a better way to do this. I adapted from a pre-existing graphic.

		seesaw.png
			Goal: Create an illustration for a seesaw problem
			I used different sizes and set accurate distances to ensure the problem was accurately represented to help students understand it visually. 

		simplemachines.png
			Goal: show a wide range of simple machines
			Since I was showing so many simple machines, I tried to keep them relatively simple.

	buoyancy
		buoyancy.png
			Goal: Explain the physics of buoyant force
			I used a lighter color for the water to avoid huge heavy ink areas. I used free body diagram style force arrows to show how forces interact.

			Note: This does not intuitively explain buoyancy. We should consider another graphic for the core concept rather than the free body diagram.

	dc1
		flashlight.png
			Goal: Explain how electricity flows.
			I used three levels to reveal how electricity works in a basic but well known circuit. The three levels mimic a zoom in. The final level simplifies the copper wire as a 1 atom thick strand of copper atoms. The graphic shows that electrons jump from one atom to another. This is different from the standard analogy of water flowing through pipes, but I believe it will give students a better understanding of the way electrons actually flow, while still letting them be able to apply those kinds of analogies.
			I adapted the atom from the atom in workbook 1. I added the correct number of electron levels, but only illustrated the electrons that were actively jumping. I added more protons and neutrons and labeled the atom to make it clear it's copper. 

			NOTE: Should likely mention in the text that the 1 atom think strand is a simplification

		plug.png
			Goal: Show the difference between conductors and insulators
			I showed copper and rubber, and the distribution of charge throughout. Similar to flashlight.png, I used different levels in a type of storytelling zoom format. 

			NOTE: I honestly don't fully understand this. It would be worthwhile to learn this more and find a better way to illustrate this, as I was basing it off the previous version of the graphic.

		Circuit_OnOff.png
			NOTE: Previous illustration. We need to update this to the new style. Pretty good for its purpose though



	dc_circuits
		N/A

	charge
		balloon.png

			Goal: show how charges can change inside of objects. 

			This illustration shows a balloon and a wall, and the charges of particles within each object. I chose to show multiple panels to better explain the cause and effect of this experiment. I included one panel that implies motion through blur. To avoid confusion, I didn't include the charges in the middle panel, so that students will focus on the outcome rather than the exact mechanisms of how charges move.

			I created the effect of motion by duplicating the balloon twice on each side, and lowering the opacity by 10% for the closest duplicate, then 20% for the farthest.

			I used red on the balloon to catch the reader's eye. I also like the contrast of the bright red and deep blue. These colors also are differentiable in gray scale.

			Note: 

		lightning.png
			Goal: show how lightning forms

			A tree, a cloud, and a lightning bolt. The cloud is negatively charged, and charge travels down the lightning towards the positively charged tree.


			Note: I've read that lightning can move bottom to top as well. Should we go into depth, or show a simple view?

Workbook 5
===========
vectors
	skydiver.png
		Goal: Explain how vectors add. In this example I used a skydiver falling, and showed the wind force plus the force of gravity. 

		NOTE: Should we use velocity vectors here instead? Especially if we're going for a "cross the river" type vector problem
momentum
	putty1.png
		Goal: Create a graphic for a classic momentum problem. Emphasize that the putty sticks together and becomes one solid.

	putty2.png
		Goal: Continued from putty1.png
		Uses a question mark for the new velocity to show what students need to find. I kept an outline in the center to show that it's the two balls of putty stuck together.
		Note: Could use shading

	icecar.png
		Goal: Create an example for a problem about momentum that uses vectors
		I made the cars different colors both to distinguish them and keep the problem interesting.
		Note: This could possibly use an "After" with the cars attached together. Cars could use shading

	poolball.png
		Goal: Create another example for a vector-based momentum problem 

		I used vectors and created an angle to demonstrate how the ball would travel when struck. Again, I used question marks to indicate what needs to be solved.
		I used a red outline with a low opacity red fill to show where the red ball would collide.

	hammerFall.png
		Goal: Show how the hammer will be pulled towards the center of the Earth by gravity.

		I put the hammer above the Earth and exaggerated the size to show that the tools fall towards the center of the Earth, not just down. 
		NOTE: How necessary is this?


	hammerTime.png
		Goal: Show the different speeds of the hammer over time as a result of the acceleration of gravity.

		I separated these into panels to make it clear that each was a "frame." I also added time at the top. I set up the numbers in the problem so that the numbers would work neatly with each second. That way at exactly 2 seconds, the hammer's velocity is 0 m/s as it reaches its peak.

		NOTE: I was considering adding an acceleration vector to show why the hammer falls, but I thought that might make it too confusing since the other vector is currently velocity rather than force.

	ghgEffect.png
		Goal: Show how the greenhouse effect works on a macro scale
		I used a custom brush in Illustrator to create the smog. I used color changes to show the sun heating up molecules. I also only showed one ray of sunlight to better visually explain how it works. 

		NOTE: The GHGs might need to be throughout the whole atmosphere instead of the top. Also it might be worth explaining how the greenhouse effect works without human caused GHG emissions and why it is helpful naturally, and why disrupting that balance is so dangerous. Also, should improve the export quality.

	ghgClose.png
		Goal: Show how the greenhouse effect works on a molecular scale
		I illustrated molecules of the most common greenhouse gases, and drew sun beams hitting them. I added lines coming off of the molecules to show that they're absorbing heat.

camera
	pinholeCamera.png
		Goal: Show how a pinhole camera works
		Previously this example used a cow. I used a tree because it makes it easier to differentiate photon beams (Still visible in gray scale). 
		I used a 3D hollow cube to get accurate light adjustments using Illustrator's 3D tools. 
		This camera shows a cutaway on the side to show what happens on the inside.
		I'm using colored lines to show how photons travel.

	pinholePoints.png
		Goal: Show how a pinhole camera lets in less light than a camera with a lens
		I focused on two points coming off of the tree for simplicity. 
		Note: Could use more emphasis on the photons being blocked


	lensPoints.png	
		Goal: Show how a lensed camera lets in less light than a pinhole camera
eye
	eyeDiagram.png
		Goal: Show how eyes work
		Used
		NOTE: Make lines neater

	nearfarSight.png 
		Goal show the difference in near and far sightedness
		I used a blur to show how the trees appear on the retina, and had a normal tree where it would have been focused. 

		NOTE: I think we need to explain the focal point better throughout all camera/light units.
