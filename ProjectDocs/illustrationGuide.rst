General guidelines I followed for Kontinua illustrations


Colors
	Kontinua Blue: 005992
	Dark Gray: c2c1c0
	Light Gray: d8d8d8
	Red: dd5041
	Blue: 53a7dc
	Yellow: f0b358
	Green: 4b9751
	Brown: 90582f

	Note: When necessary, I adjust the brightness values


Arrows
	"Fancy" arrow: Forces/any motion referenced as math in the text     
	Normal arrows: movement, anything that's not math or a force


Call-outs:
	Text callout: dashed line - - - - - 
	Explosion/zoom callout: solid line and solid circle -----O


Shading
	When applicable, I try to add shading to give depth to the illustrations.
		Example: Rocket unit
	
	No shading on cross sections
		Example: lenses, jet engine


Isometric
	For some illustrations I use an isometric view to give more context.

	Example: Fabrication Chapter (3D printer, CNC, laser cutter)

	Shortcuts:
		I used shortcut actions in Illustrator that do the following:
			Top: 
				- Scale vertical 86.06%
				- Shear 30°
				- Rotate -30°
			Left:
				- Scale vertical 86.06%
				- Shear -30°
				- Rotate -30°

			Right: 
				- Scale vertical 86.06%
				- Shear 30°
				- Rotate 30°


Organization
	Illustrator file - Contains all of the illustrations for the chapter as artboards. Also contains some of the excess

	PNGs - Exported illustrations

	Student.tex - LaTex file where you insert all the filenames. Ensure there is a line break before/after.




Illustrator Export

	Since I was exporting many illustrations at once, I just set up one illustrator file for each chapter.
	I used export as then just selected the artboards in the range.


Dimensions
	10 in x 8 in
		Standard
	15 in x 8 in
		Use for double or very wide graphics
			Multiply fonts by 1.5x due to scaling in Latex
			
	After the illustration is done, trim down the vertical to fit the illustration
