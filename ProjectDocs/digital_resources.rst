Digital Resources

You can think of each chapter as made up of several learning
objectives.  The sequence, then, is a directed graph â€” each chapter
covers some objectives and relies upon some prerequisite objectives.

Each of these objectives gets a short unique ID. For example, "atmos" might represent
the objective of having the student understand the idea of atmospheric pressure.

In addition to an ID, each objective gets:

* A description: "Atmospheric pressure and altitude" (required)
* Some online video links (optional)
* Some online reference links (optional)

Besides a list of objectives that a chapter supplies and the list of objectives that
are prerequisites,  the chapter can have some files the student can use.  For example, maybe
a Python program that the student can download and run.

===================
gather_resources.py
===================

In the Build directory, there is a Python program called ``gather_resources.py``.

This program walks the chapter directories, parsing each ``digital_resources.json`` and
creating a web page for each book. Here, for example, is the section for "The Physics of Gases":

.. image:: webresources.png
    :width: 700 px

It is run as you would expect from inside the ``Build`` directory::

    python3 gather_resources.py


======================
digital_resources.json
======================

Here is an example of ``digital_resources.json`` file for a chapter::

    {
    "files": [
    {
      "path": "ar_plot.py",
      "desc": "Python program that generated PDF of molecular speeds"
    }
      ],
        "requires": [
        "atom",
        "fma",
        "mole",
        "energy-forms"
      ],
     "covers": [

          ]
        },
        {

        },

          "desc": "The Ideal Gas Law",
          "videos": [
            "https://youtu.be/qObcdZj8YTM?si=KqJZqU7QSIuc91ol"
          ],
          "references": [
           "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

The structure makes sense, right?  Yes, but it is a real hassle to try to type it, and
every chapter needs one. So:
