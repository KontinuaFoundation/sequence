\chapter{Systems of Equations as Matrices}\label{chap:syseqma}
You have already gained experience with matrices earlier in this module, as well as when you have used spreadsheets. In this chapter, you will learn the types of matrices and get an introduction to some of the special matrices used for various calculations. 

As you know, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The individual numbers in the matrix are called elements or entries. Matrices can be described by their dimensions. For example, a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is a 2 by 3 matrix.

$$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

More generally, a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is referred to as an $m \times n$ matrix, or simply an $m$-by-$n$ matrix; $m$ and $n$ are its dimensions.

The general form of a $2 \times 3$ matrix $A$ is:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\section{Types of Matrices}
\index{matrices!shapes of}

Matrices can be described by their shape:
\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{Row Matrix}] A matrix of size $1\times n$ with $1$ row and $n$ columns.
    \item[\textbf{Column Matrix}] A matrix of size $n\times 1$ with $n$ rows and $1$ column, typically used to represent vectors. 
    \item[\textbf{Square Matrix}] A matrix of size $n\times n$, containing the same number of rows and columns
    \item[\textbf{Rectangular Matrix}] A matrix of size $m \times n$, that has an unequal number of rows and columns.
    
\end{description}
\index{matrices!properties of}
They can also be described by their unique numerical properties. Special matrices that come in handy for certains types of computations. These are a few of the most common special matrices:
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Zero Matrix}] A matrix that only contains entries that are zero. $$\vecb{0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0}$$ The matrix above could also be $$0_{2\times 2}$$
       \item[\textbf{Diagonal Matrix}] A square matrix with nonzero entries along the diagonal, and zeroes everywhere else. $$\vecb{2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 6}$$
	\item[\textbf{Identity Matrix}] A diagonal matrix with entries of 1 along the diagonal. $$\vecb{1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1}$$
	\item[\textbf{Symmetric Matrix}] A Symmetric matrix is a matrix, when transposed, becomes itself.
	$$
       A = \begin{bmatrix}
       20 & 40 & 60 \\
       40 & 50 & 80 \\
       60 & 80 & 100
       \end{bmatrix}
       $$
	\item[\textbf{Triangular Matrix}] This is a special square matrix that can be upper triangular or lower triangular. If upper, the main diagonal and all entries above it are nonzero while the lower entries are all zero. If lower, the main diagonal and all the entries below it are nonzero, while the upper entries are all zero. A matrix that is both upper and lower triangular becomes a diagonal matrix.
	
       Upper Triangular Matrix
       $$
       \begin{bmatrix}
       2 & 3 & 1 \\
       0 & 5 & 4 \\
       0 & 0 & 6
       \end{bmatrix}
       $$
       Lower Triangular matrix
       $$
       \begin{bmatrix}
       7 & 0 & 0 \\
       2 & 5 & 0 \\
       4 & 3 & 9
       \end{bmatrix}
       $$
\end{description}

\subsection{Symmetric Matrices}
\index{symmetric matrices}
If you want to find out if a square matrix is symmetric, you need to transpose it. If the transpose is equal to the original matrix, then the matrix is symmetric.

To transpose a matrix, flip it over its diagonal so that the rows and columns are switched, like this:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3} \\
a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
After transposing:
$$
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{1,1} & a_{2,1} & a_{3,1} \\
a_{1,2} & a_{2,2} & a_{3,2} \\
a_{1,3} & a_{2,3} & a_{3,3}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Note that $A^T$ means the transpose of A. 

Let's see how this works for the following square matrix, A.
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Switch the rows and columns to get the transpose:
$$
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 5 \\
3 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Notice that $A = A^T$, so the matrix is symmetric.

What about matrix B? 
$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 4 & 5 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Switch the rows and columns to get the transpose:
$$
B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 7 \\
2 & 4 & 8 \\
3 & 5 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that $B \neq B^T$, so B is not symmetrical.

\begin{Exercise}[title={Matrix Transposition}, label=matrix-transpose01]

$$A = \begin{bmatrix}
 		3 & -2 &4  \\
 		-2 & 6 &2 \\
 		4 & 2 & 3 
	  \end{bmatrix}$$
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=matrix-transpose01]
$$A =  A^t = 
	  \begin{bmatrix}
 		3 & -2 & 4  \\
 		-2 & 6 & 2 \\
 		4 & 2 & 3 
	\end{bmatrix}$$
\end{Answer}
\section{Systems of Equations}

We have talked a lot about matrices and vectors. Now we can use matrices and vectors to solve systems of equations. A system of linear equations can be written compactly using matrices and vectors. This matrix representation allows us to use algebraic tools such as row operations and matrix multiplication to analyze and solve the system more efficiently. Let's look at a very simple example from a previous section.

\[\begin{cases}
1x_1 + 2x_2 = -1 \\
2x_1 + 0x_2 = 4
\end{cases}\]

We can write this in the form of a matrix! This may come as a surprise to some of you. How can we do this? Let's rewrite the the coefficients as a matrix and the $x_n$'s as column vector, and the constant vector, or right-hand-side vector, called $\vec{b}$. 

Here is the coefficient matrix which we will call $A$:
\[A = \vecb{1 & 2 \\ 2 & 0}\]

Then we can write the column vector of $x$, which we will terminalize as $\vec{x}$
\[\vec{x} = \vecb{x_1 \\ x_2}\] 

And we can write the $\vec{b}$ as the following column vector:

\[
\vec{b} = \vecb{-1 \\ -4}
\]

Now, if we multiply $A$ and $\vec{x}$,
$$A\vec{x} = \vecb{1 & 2 \\ 2 & 0}\vecb{x_1 \\ x_2} = \vecb{1x_1 + 2x_2 \\ 2x_1 + 0x_2}$$

We get exactly the left-hand sides of our original system of equations!
Therefore, when we set this equal to the right-hand-side vector $\vec{b}$:
$$\vec{b}=\vecb{-1 \\ 4}$$
we get the fundamental system of equation formula represented as a matrix Equation
\begin{equation}
       A\vec{x} = \vec{b}
       \label{eq:matrixform}
\end{equation}

This is a very important equation for linear algebra as a whole. Notice that the size of matrix has to respect the matrix multiplication rules:
\[\underset{m \times n}{A} \cdot \underset{n \times 1}{\vec{b}} = \underset{m\times 1}{\vec{p}}\]

\begin{Exercise}[title=Matrix Equation, label=matrixeq1]
       Rewrite the systems of equations in matrix form and identify $A$, $\vec{x}$, and $\vec{b}$. 
       \[\begin{cases}
       -4x_1 + 9x_2 - 8x_3= 5\\
       -1x_1 + 0x_2 + 6x_3= 7
       \end{cases}\]
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=matrixeq1]
     \[A = \vecb{-4 & 9 & -8 \\ -1 & 0 & 6}, \quad \vec{x} = \vecb{x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3}, \quad \vec{b} = \vecb{5 \\ 7}\]
     \[A\vec{x}=\vec{b} \implies \vecb{-4 & 9 & -8 \\ -1 & 0 & 6}\vecb{x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3} = \vecb{5 \\ 7}\]
\end{Answer}

\section{Row-Echelon Form}
This brings up the question, how can we solve for the $\vec{x}$? There are multiple ways, but most commonly we form an augmented matrix and solve for Row-Echelon Form. 
\subsection{The Augmented Matrix}
What is the augmented matrix? It is a way of represented the $A$ matrix and $\vec{b}$ vector. We write the $A$ matrix, seperated by a vertical line, and then writing the $\vec{b}$ vector:
$$\begin{array}{c} [A \mid \vec{b}] =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} & \vert & b_1 \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} & \vert & b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots &        & \vdots & \vert & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} & \vert & b_m
\end{bmatrix} \end{array}$$

The left block contains all the coefficients of the system of equations, and the right block contains only the solutions. Then, to solve for $\vec{x}$, we perform \textit{Elementary Row Operations} to find the \textit{Row-Echelon Form}, mathematically stated as $\text{rref}(A\vert \vec{b})$. Let's continue with the matrix vector set we were experimenting with:
$$A\vec{x} = \vecb{1 & 2 \\ 2 & 0}\vecb{x_1 \\ x_2} = \vecb{1x_1 + 2x_2 \\ 2x_1 + 0x_2}$$
This can be written as an augmented matrix:

$$\vecb{A\vert \vec{b}} = \vecb{1 & 2 &\vert & -1 \\ 2 & 0 & \vert & 4}$$


\subsection{Elementary Row Operations}
The Row-Echelon Form of a matrix is an \emph{equivalent} form of a matrix obtained through Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan elimination. There are lots of videos on this process online, so multiple videos included in your digital resources to walk you through the process. The rules of Gaussian Elimination are simple, only 3 different elementary row operations, or ERO's can be performed:

\begin{itemize}
       \item Swapping two rows
       \item multiply a row by a non-zero scalar
       \item dd a multiple of one row to another row
\end{itemize}
Why do these operations preserve the given linear system? Swapping two rows only changes the order in which the equations are written and therefore has no effect on the solution set. Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar corresponds to multiplying both sides of an equation by the same scalar, which does not alter its solutions. Finally, if two equations are satisfied by the same solution, then any linear combination of those equations is also satisfied by that solution; in particular, adding a multiple of one equation to another preserves the solution set. Before and after each operation, the augmented matrix contains exactly the same information as the system of equations and therefore represents the same solution set.

With these ERO's, we are trying to achieve a matrix with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Leading entries move to the right as you go down
\item Rows of zeros, if exist, are at the bottom
\item Entries below each leading entry are zero
\end{itemize}

Lets walk through the steps to simplify $\text{ref}(A\vert \vec{b})$:




\section{Reduced Row Echelon Form}







\section{Creating Matrices in Python}
Create a file called \filename{matrices\_creation.py} and enter this code:
\begin{Verbatim}
# import the python module that supports matrices
import numpy as np
# Use the function np.array to define a matrix that 
# contains specific values that you supply.
A = np.array([[ 5, 1, 3], 
              [ 1, -1, 8], 
              [ 6, 2, 1]])
# The transpose function returns 
A.transpose()
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it, you should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
array([[ 5, 1, 6], 
       [ 1, -1, 2], 
       [ 3, 8, 1]])
\end{Verbatim}
As you can see, $A\neq A^T$, so A is not symmetric.
Try another: 
\begin{Verbatim}
# create a matrix, B
B = np.array([[ 5, 1, 6], 
              [ 1, -1, 2], 
              [ 6, 2, 1]])
B.transpose()
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it, you should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
array([[ 5, 1, 6], 
       [ 1, -1, 2], 
       [ 6, 2, 1]])
\end{Verbatim}
B is symmetric. You can actually transpose any matrix using this function, but a matrix cannot be symmetric unless it is square. 

Try this code to see what happens when you transpose a rectangular matrix. 
\begin{Verbatim}
# create a matrix, J
J = np.array([[ 5, 1, 3, 0], 
              [ 1, -1, 8, 11], 
              [ 6, 2, 1,-7]])
J.transpose()
\end{Verbatim}
Note that transposing a rectangular matrix changes its dimension from 3 by 4 to 4 by 3. You should see a transposed matrix, but it's not symmetric.
\begin{Verbatim}
array([[ 5,  1,  6],
       [ 1, -1,  2],
       [ 3,  8,  1],
       [ 0, 11, -7]])
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Creating Special Matrices in Python}
 Use the same file to add this code for creating a zero matrix.
\begin{Verbatim}
# create an 8 by 10 Zero matrix.
 C = np.zeros((8, 10))
 C
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it, you should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
array([[0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]])
\end{Verbatim}
Add the following code to create an 8 by 8 Identity matrix.
\begin{Verbatim}
# create an 8 by 8 Identity matrix 
 D = np.eye(8)
 D
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it, you should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
array([[1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1.]])
\end{Verbatim}
As you progress in your studies, you will learn the importance of diagonal matrices and of extracting the diagonal of a matrix. Let's see how to extract a diagonal, then create a diagonal matrix.
\begin{Verbatim}
# create a  matrix 
W = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], 
              [5, 6, 7, 8], 
              [-8, -7, -6, -5],
              [-4, -3, -2, -1]])
\end{Verbatim}
Extract the main diagonal using np.diag(<array>,<diagonal to extract>). 
Passing 0 as the second parameter specifies the main diagonal. A positive value extracts a diagonal from the upper part. A negative value extracts a diagonal from the lower part. Run this code then experiment passing other values to see what you get.
\begin{Verbatim}
print(np.diag(W,0))
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it, you should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
array([ 1,  6, -6, -1])
\end{Verbatim}
You can also use np.diag() to create a diagonal matrix from a 1D array. In this case, do not pass a second paramenter.
\begin{Verbatim}
Q = np.array([1, 2, 3])
DiagArray = np.diag(Q))
print(DiagArray)
\end{Verbatim}
When you run it you should see;
\begin{Verbatim}
[[1 0 0]
 [0 2 0]
 [0 0 3]]
\end{Verbatim}
Python has functions for extracting upper and lower triangular matrices. Try these:
\begin{Verbatim}
print(np.triu(W))
print(np.tril(W))
\end{Verbatim}
You should see:
\begin{Verbatim}
[[ 1  2  3  4]
 [ 0  6  7  8]
 [ 0  0 -6 -5]
 [ 0  0  0 -1]]
 
[[ 1  0  0  0]
 [ 5  6  0  0]
 [-8 -7 -6  0]
 [-4 -3 -2 -1]]
\end{Verbatim}
