\chapter{Representing Natural Numbers}

Natural numbers are positive whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. -5 is not a natural
number. $\pi$ is not a natural number. $\frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural
number.

\section{Base-10 (Decimal)}
You are used to seeing the natural numbers represented in a \textbf{base-10}
\newterm{Hindu-Arabic} or the \newterm{Decimal} numeral system. That is, when you see 2531 you
think ``2 thousands, 5 hundreds, 3 tens, and 1 one.'' Rewritten, this is:

$$2 \times 10^3 + 5 \times 10^2 + 3 \times 10^1 + 1 \times 10^0$$

The \newterm{radix} is the amount of number of unique values a base can have before increasing the amount of digits. 
For example, values 0, 1, 2, $\cdots$, 8, 9 are all the values for base-10. 
Once 1 is added added to 9, we need to increase the amount of digits in a number. 

In any Hindu-Arabic system, the location of the digits is meaningful:
101 is different from 110; the position of a number indicates it's magnitude. Here are those numbers in Roman numerals:
CI and CX. Roman numerals didn't have a symbol for zero at all.
%should we expand on roman numerals..? could be interesting but not needed?

The Hindu-Arabic system gave us really straightforward algorithms for
addition and multiplication. For addition, you memorized the following table:

\begin{tabular}{ c || c | c | c | c | c | c| c| c| c| c }
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
 \hline
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
2 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11\\
3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12\\
4 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13\\
5 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14\\
6 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15\\
7 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16\\
8 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17\\
9 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 16 & 17 & 18\\
\end{tabular}

When you multiplied two number together, you simply multiplied each
pair of digits. $254 \times 26$ might look like this:

\begin{tabular} {r c c c c | c}
 & & 2 & 5 & 4 & \\
 & & $\times$ & 2 & 6 & \\
 \hline
& &  & 2 & 4 & $6 \times 4$\\
& & 3 & 0 & & $6 \times 5$ \\
& 1 & 2 & & & $6 \times 2$ \\
& & & 8 & & $2 \times 4$ \\
& 1 & 0 & & & $2 \times 5$\\
+ & 4 & & & & $2 \times 2$\\
 \hline
 6 & 6 & 0 & 4
 \end{tabular}
 

For multiplication, you memorized this table:

\begin{tabular}{ c || c | c | c | c | c | c| c| c| c| c}
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
 \hline
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
 2 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 & 18 \\
 3 & 0 & 3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 24 & 27 \\
 4 & 0 & 4 & 8 & 12 & 16 & 20 & 24 & 28 & 32 & 36 \\
 5 & 0 & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 45 \\
 6 & 0 & 6 & 12 & 18 & 24 & 30 & 36 & 42 & 48 & 54 \\
 7 & 0 & 7 & 14 & 21 & 28 & 35 & 42 & 49 & 56 & 63 \\
 9 & 0 & 9 & 18 & 27 & 36 & 45 & 54 & 63 & 72 & 81 
 \end{tabular}

\section{Base-2 (Binary)}
\index{binary}\index{base-2}
Binary, on the other hand, has only 2 digits it can have: $0$ or $1$. 
This kind of number system is often used for electrical and computer systems because the values can only be \textbf{on} or \textbf{off}.

Each digit in a binary number represents a power of $2$, starting from the rightmost digit (the least significant bit, or LSB). For example:

\[
  \dots + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
\]
For example,
\[
1011_2 = (1 \cdot 2^3) + (0 \cdot 2^2) + (1 \cdot 2^1) + (1 \cdot 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11_{10}
\]\footnote{The subscripts represent the radix or base.}

Because the radix is 2, the numbers increase differently:
\index{binary!counting in}
\begin{align*}
  0&: 0 \\
  1&: 1 \\
  2&: 10 \\
  3&: 11 \\
  4&: 100 \rightarrow (2^{2}\cdot 1) + 0 + 0 = 4 \\
  5&: 101 \\
  6&: 110 \\
  7&: 111 \\
  8&: 1000 \\
  \cdots& \\
  15&: 1111
  \cdots& \\
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Conversion from Decimal to Binary}
To convert $13_{10}$ to binary, repeatedly divide by $2$ and record the remainders until the divisor reaches 0 or 1:
\[
13 \div 2 = 6 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
6 \div 2 = 3 \text{ remainder } 0 \\
3 \div 2 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1 \\
1 \div 2 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1
\]
Reading from bottom to top, $13_{10} = 1101_2$.

\subsection{Bits and Bytes}
A singular binary digit (0 or 1) is called a \newterm{bit}. \index{bit}\index{byte}
A lightbulb, switch, or any sort of \newterm{Boolean} value (true or false) can be represented as a bit.
A single binary digit is called a \emph{bit}. 
Eight bits form a \emph{byte}, which is a common unit of storage in computer systems:
\[
1\ \text{byte} = 8\ \text{bits}
\]
For example, the binary sequence $01001000$ represents one byte of data.

We won't go into the depths of it here, but here are the basics of computer architecture. 
\index{computer architecture}
There are codes of 4-bit sequences that form up the \newterm{memory}. \index{memory}
This can form the sections of it into different data types:
FIXME make this into a table
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Character}: 1 byte, 8 bits, used for ASCII (Hexadecimal numbers)
  \item \textbf{Integer}: 4 bytes, 32 bits, allows for only positive values up to $2^{32}$ signed numbers from [$-2^{31}, \; 2^{31}-1$]
  \item \textbf{Double}: 8 bytes, 64 bits, decimal values
\end{itemize}

Strings are formed by listing characters in consecutive memory addresses such that they are marked by a starting memory address and ending memory address. 

8-bit binary numbers can be used to signify positive or negative numbers.  \index{signed bits}
The most significant bit (MSB) will alter sign, causing the range to be $[-2^{7}, \; 2^{7}-1]$. If the byte is negative (in terms of bits), invert each bit and add 1 to the inverted result. The other way is to multiply the MSB by negative one, and add until the value is reached, as seen below. 

\[
-85_{10} = -1 \times 2^7 + 0 \times 2^6 + 1 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 1010 1011
\]

Binary can be easy converted to \newterm{Hexadecimal}. 

\section{Base-16 (Hexadecimal)}
\index{hexadecimal}
Hexadecimal (from the latin \emph{hexa} and \emph{deca} for 16) is a representation of number with a radix of 16. Digits are represented through numeric numbers 0-9 and \newterm{A-F}. 

Counting to 16 in hex goes as follows:
\begin{align*}
  &1 \\
  &2 \\
  &3 \\
  &\dots \\
  &9 \\
  &\text{A} \; (\text{decimal value} \;  10) \\
  &\text{B} \; (\text{decimal value} \; 11) \\
  &\text{C} \; (\text{decimal value} \; 12) \\
  &\text{D} \; (\text{decimal value} \; 13) \\
  &\text{E} \; (\text{decimal value} \; 14) \\
  &\text{F} \; (\text{decimal value} \; 15)
\end{align*}

Converting between binary and hexadecimal is easier because the hex radix ($16 = 2^4$) is a power of the binary radix ($2^1$). 

It takes 4 binary digits to represent 1 hex digit: $15 =$ F

For example,
\[0\text{x}47 = 0100 \; 0111_{2}\]
\[0\text{x}\text{BD} = 1011 \; 1101_{2}\]


\subsection{Hex Color Codes}

Hex colors are represented by 6 hexadecimal digits: 2 red, 2 blue, and 2 green. FIXME finish this


\section{Base-8 (Octal)}
\index{Octal}
Octal is another representation of radix 8. Digits go from 0 to 7, and the number of digits increase when that threshold is passed. 

Just as in the above systems, hexadecimal increases by the radix --- powers of 8. For example,
\[
135 = 2 \times 8^2 + 0\times 8^1 + 6\times 8^0 = 206
\]


FIXME this needs to be written. Why does Octal representation matter for students?
