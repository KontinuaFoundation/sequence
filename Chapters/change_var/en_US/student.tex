\chapter{Change of Variables}

Let's say that we are making ice spheres, and we tell you that the radius of the ice spheres is normally distributed with a mean
of 0.7 cm and a standard deviation of 0.08 cm. You can then draw the probability distribution and cumulative distribution for that:

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{before.png}

This includes lines indicating the mean and two standard deviations on each side.

Now,  let's say we ask you what the cumulative distribution is for the \emph{mass} of the balloons.   A cubic centimeter of ice weighs about gram, so if you know
the radius of a particular ice sphere,  it is easy to compute the mass of it:

$$m = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$

So, for example,  if a sphere has a radius of 5cm,  its mass in grams is  $\frac{4 \pi (0.7^3)}{3}  \approx 1.44$ g.

Thinking about the graph of the cumulative distribution, if half the balloons have a radius less than 5 cm,  then half of the balloons have a mass less than 523.6 g. For each point on the cumulative graph,  we can use the radius of that point to compute the corresponding mass --- the CDF gets stretched out:

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{cdf_after.png}

If $F$ is the original cumulative distribution function, and $g$ is the function that maps the new variable (mass, in this case) to the old one (radius),  then the 
new cumulative distribution function $H$ is given by 

$$H(m) = F(g(m))$$

In this case, $F$ is the cumulative function for the normal distribution, with mean $0.7$ and standard deviation of $0.08$.  $g$ maps the mass to the radius:

$$g(m) =\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4 \pi}}\right) x^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

\section{Making a Probability Density Function}

Now, we know how to calculate a new cumulative distribution function using the new variable.  However,  we usually want a probability density.

Here is the CDF and the PDF of the mass of the ice spheres:

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pdf.png}

Reminder: The probability density function is the derivative of the cumulative distribution function.    We know the CDF is

$$H(m) = F(g(m))$$

By the chain rule:

$$H'(m) = F'(g(m))g'(m)$$

The function $F$ is the cumulative distribution for the normal distribution with mean $0.7$ and standard deviation of $0.08$.  So, we know its derivative:

$$F'(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$

where  $\mu = 0.7$ and $\sigma = 0.08$.

We've already said that 

$$g(m) = \left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4 \pi}}\right) m^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

Which is easy to differentiate:

$$g'(m) = \left(\frac{1}{3} \right) \left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4 \pi}}\right) m^{-\frac{2}{3}}$$

Here, then, is the code to generate that last plot:

# What is F'(g(m))g'(m)?
pdf_values = norm.pdf(r_values, loc=MEAN_RADIUS, scale=STD_RADIUS) * dg_values

# Sanity check: It should integrate to a little less then 1.0
dx = (MAX_MASS - MIN_MASS)/N

\section{Decreasing Conversions}

The last case (mass and radius) is relatively straightforward, because the function $g$ is always increasing.  What if we have a change of variables where 
$g$ is decreasing? For example,  $V= IR$ so $\frac{V}{R} = I$.

Let's say that you work at a lightbulb factory and you sample the lightbulbs to see what their resistance is.  You find the resistances of the lightbulbs are normally distributed with a mean of 24 ohms and a standard deviation of 3 ohms.  The voltage will be exactly 12 volts.  What is the PDF of the currents that will pass through the lightbulbs?

$$I = \frac{12}{R}$$

so 

$$g(x) = \frac{12}{x}$$

is the function that will convert the current to resistance.  Taking the derivative,  we get:

$$g'(i) = -\frac{12}{x^2}$$
