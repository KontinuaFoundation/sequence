\chapter{Simple Machines}

As mentioned earlier, physicists define work as the force applied times the 
distance over which it is applied. For example, if you push your car 100 meters 
with a force of 17 newtons, you have done 1700 joules of work.

Humans have long needed to move heavy objects, so many centuries ago, we 
developed simple machines to reduce the amount of force necessary to perform 
such tasks. These include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Levers
    \item Pulleys
    \item Inclined planes
    \item Gears
    \item Hydraulics
    \item Screws
    \item Wedges
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{simplemachines.png}

While these machines can reduce the force needed, they do not change the total 
amount of work that must be done. For instance, if the force is reduced by a 
factor of three, the distance over which the force must be applied increases by 
the same factor.

The term \textit{mechanical advantage} refers to the increase in force achieved 
by using these machines.

\section{Mechanical Advantage}

As indicated above, mechanical advantage is the ratio between the force output 
by the machine and the force the user puts into the machine:
$$ MA = \frac{F_{out}}{F_{in}}$$

Since the input force is \textit{applied} to the simple machine, sometimes the 
input force is called an applied force and abbreviated as $F_a$. For example, 
you only need to apply a relatively little force to your car's brakes in order 
for the hydraulic braking system to apply enough force to your tires to stop 
them spinning (we'll examine this further below). 

\subsection{What does it mean to work hard?}
Humans use simple machines to ``make work easier", but what does this mean in a 
physics sense? Does using a machine actually decrease the amount of work the 
user has to do? When we say a task is easier, we usually mean \textit{we have to 
apply less force}. You might say that it is ``less work" to push something up a 
shallow incline than up a steep incline. But does the person pushing \textit{
actually do less work} (in a physics sense), or does that work simply require 
a smaller force? We'll answer this question by examining the physics of incline 
planes below, and the results will be true for all simple machines. 

\section{Inclined Planes}

Inclined planes, or ramps, allow you to roll or slide objects to a higher 
level. Steeper ramps require less mechanical advantage. For instance, it is much 
easier to roll a ball up a wheelchair ramp than a skateboard ramp.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rampcomparison.png}

Assuming the incline has a constant steepness, the mechanical advantage is 
equal to the ratio of the length of the inclined plane to the height it rises. 
%note to self: show why this is true or have students derive eqn in exercise -Max

If friction is neglected, the force required to push a weight up the inclined 
plane is given by:

\[
F_A = \frac{V}{L} F_G
\]

          \node[] at (6.65, 1) {$V$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

(We will discuss sine function later, but in case you're familiar with it, note that:

\[
\frac{V}{L} = \sin{\theta}
\]

where \( \theta \) is the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal surface.)

Let's compare the force needed and work done when pushing a load up steep 
versus shallow ramps. Consider a family on moving day: there's a hand trolley 
loaded with 200 N (about 45 pounds) of boxes. If the bed of the moving truck is 
1.5 m high, how much work would it take the light the boxes straight up into 
the truck? What about with a ramp? 

First, let's look at how much force and work is needed if you were to lift the 
entire 200 N load straight up into the air. You'd need to apply 200 N of force 
upwards for a distance of 1.5 m:
$$W = F \cdot d = \left( 200 N \right) \left( 1.5 m \right) = 300 J$$

So, without a ramp, you would have to apply 200 N and do 300 J of work. Suppose 
your moving truck comes with a ramp that has an incline of 15 degrees:

            	node[right, yshift = -0.25cm, font = \scriptsize] 
            	{

            	};

            {

\begin{Exercise}[title={Ramp}, label=ramp]
A barrel of oil weighs 136 kilograms. You can apply a force of up to 300 newtons. You need to get the barrel onto a platform that is 2 meters high. What is the shortest length of inclined plane you can use?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=ramp]
The weight of the barrel is \( 136 \times 9.8 = 1332.8 \) newtons.

Let \( L \) be the length of the inclined plane. The force needed to push the barrel up is related by:

\[
300 = \frac{2}{L} \times 1332.8
\]

Solving for \( L \), we find \( L = \frac{2 \times 1332.8}{300} \approx 8.885 \) meters.
\end{Answer}

\section{Levers}

A lever pivots on a fulcrum. To decrease the necessary force, the load is placed closer to the fulcrum than where the force is applied.

Physicists also discuss the concept of \newterm{torque} created by a force. When you apply force to a lever, the torque is the product of the force you exert and the distance from the point of rotation.

Torque is typically measured in newton-meters.

To balance two torques, the products of force and distance must be equal. Thus, assuming the forces are applied in the correct direction, the equation becomes:

\[
R_L F_L = R_A F_A
\]

where \( R_L \) and \( R_A \) represent the distances from the fulcrum to where the loadâ€™s force and the applied force are exerted, respectively, and \( F_L \) and \( F_A \) are the magnitudes of the forces.

\begin{Exercise}[title={Lever}, label=lever]
Paul, who weighs 70 kilograms, sits on a see-saw 4 meters from the fulcrum. Jan, who weighs 50 kilograms, wishes to balance the see-saw. How far should Jan sit from the fulcrum?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=lever]
Paul exerts a force of \( 70 \times 9.8 = 686 \) newtons at a distance of 4 meters from the fulcrum, creating a torque of \( 686 \times 4 = 2744 \) newton-meters. Jan exerts a force of \( 50 \times 9.8 = 490 \) newtons.

Let \( r \) be the distance from the fulcrum to Jan's seat. To balance the torques:

\[
490 \times r = 2744
\]

Solving for \( r \), we find \( r = \frac{2744}{490} \approx 5.6 \) meters.
\end{Answer}

\section{Gears}

Gears have teeth that mesh with each other. When you apply torque to one gear, it transfers torque to the other. The resulting torque is increased or decreased depending on the ratio of the number of teeth on the gears. 
%explain connection between teeth and radius
%example for torque vs power: riding your bike up a hill, gears in your car

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{gearsNew.png}

If \( N_A \) is the number of teeth on the gear you are turning with a torque of \( T_A \), and \( N_L \) is the number of teeth on the gear it is turning, the resulting torque is:

\[
T_L = \frac{N_A}{N_L} T_A
\]
% maybe add more on this? not sure how important it is or if it needs to be emphasized more
\begin{Exercise}[title={Gears}, label=gear]
In a bicycle, the goal is not always to gain mechanical advantage, but to spin the pedals slower while applying more force.

You like to pedal your bike at 70 revolutions per minute. The chainring connected to your pedals has 53 teeth. The circumference of your tire is 2.2 meters. You want to ride at 583 meters per minute.

How many teeth should the rear sprocket have?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=gear]
The equation relating these quantities is:

\[
583 = 70 \times 2.2 \times \frac{53}{n}
\]

Solving for \( n \), we find \( n = 14 \) teeth.
\end{Answer}

\section{Hydraulics}

In a hydraulic system, such as a car's braking system, you exert force on a piston filled with fluid. The fluid transmits this pressure into another cylinder, where it pushes yet another piston that moves the load. The pressure at each end of the hydraulic system must be the same. 

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hydraulicsNew.png}

\newterm{Pressure} is force applied to an area; it is calculated by dividing the force by the area.  The pressure in the fluid is typically measured in pascals (Pa), which is equivalent to \(N / m^2\). We will use pascals for this calculation.

To calculate the pressure you create, divide the force applied $F_{a}$ by the area of the piston head $A$. To determine the force on the other piston, multiply the pressure by the area of the second piston.
% added equation for pressure
\[
P = \frac{F_{a_1}}{A_1} = \frac{F_{a_2}}{A_2}
\]


\begin{Exercise}[title={Hydraulics}, label=hydraulics]
Your car has disc brakes. When you apply 2,500,000 pascals of pressure to the brake fluid, the car stops quickly. As the car designer, you want this to require only 12 newtons of force from the driver's foot.

What should the radius of the master cylinder (the piston the driver pushes) be?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=hydraulics]
We are solving for the radius \( r \) of the piston. The area of the piston is \( \pi r^2 \), so the pressure is:

\[
\text{Pressure} = \frac{12}{\pi r^2}
\]

Setting the pressure equal to 2,500,000 pascals:

\[
2,500,000 = \frac{12}{\pi r^2}
\]

Solving for \( r \), we find:

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{12}{\pi \times 2.5 \times 10^6}} \approx 0.00124 \text{ meters}.
\]
\end{Answer}
