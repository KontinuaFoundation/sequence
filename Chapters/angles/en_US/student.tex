\chapter{Angles}

In the following recommend videos, the narrator talks about
lines, line segments, and rays. When mathematicians talk about
\emph{lines}\index{lines}, they mean a straight line that goes forever in two 
directions. If you pick any two points on that line, the space between 
them is a \emph{line segment}\index{line segment}. If you take any line, pick 
a point on it, and discard all the points on one side of the point, that 
is a \emph{ray}\index{ray}. All three have no width.

Watch the following videos from Khan Academy:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to angles: \url{https://youtu.be/H-de6Tkxej8}
\item Measuring angles in degrees: \url{https://youtu.be/92aLiyeQj0w} 
\end{itemize}

When two lines cross, they form four angles:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \coordinate (a) at (0, 1.5);
  \coordinate (b) at (1.6, 2);
  \coordinate (c) at (1.6, 1.5);
  \coordinate (d) at (0, 1);
  \coordinate [circle, fill, inner sep=1pt](e) at (0.8, 1.5) ;
  \draw [->](e)--(a) node[left] {$A$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)--(b) node[right] {$B$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)--(c) node[right] {$C$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)node[above]{$E$}--(d) node[left] {D} ;
  \pic [draw, <->, "$\scriptstyle  \angle AEB$ ", angle radius = 0.8cm, 
  angle eccentricity=1.3] {angle = b--e--a};
  \pic [draw, <->, "$\scriptstyle  \angle BEC$ ", angle radius = 1.1cm, 
  angle eccentricity = 1.5] {angle = c--e--b};
  \pic [draw, <->, "$\scriptstyle  \angle CED$ ", angle radius = 0.8cm, 
  angle eccentricity=1.3] {angle = d--e--c};
  \pic [draw, <->, "$\scriptstyle  \angle DEA$ ", angle radius = 1.1cm, 
  angle eccentricity=1.5] {angle = a--e--d};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


What do we know about those angles? (Note that $m \angle$ means "the measure of angle")
\begin{itemize}
\item The sum of any two adjacent angles adds to be $180^\circ$ So, for 
example, $m \angle AEB + m \angle BEC = 180^\circ$. We use the phrase ``adds to 
be $180^{\circ}$'' so often that we have a special word for it: 
\emph{supplementary}.\index{supplementary angles}
\item The sum of all four angles is $360^\circ$.
\item Angles opposite each other are equal. So, for example, $m \angle AEB = m 
\angle CED$.
\item On any \emph{horizontal} line segment with angles in between it, the sum of the angles must add up to $180^\circ$. For example, $\overline{AC}$ is a horizontal line, so angles between it must sum to $180^\circ$.
\end{itemize}

In a diagram, to indicate that two angles are equal we often put hash marks in 
the angle:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \coordinate (a) at (0, 1.5);
  \coordinate (b) at (1.6, 2);
  \coordinate (c) at (1.6, 1.5);
  \coordinate (d) at (0, 1);
  \coordinate [circle, fill, inner sep=1pt](e) at (0.8, 1.5) ;
  \draw [->](e)--(a) node[left] {$A$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)--(b) node[right] {$B$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)--(c) node[right] {$C$}  ;
  \draw [->](e)node[above]{$E$}--(d) node[left] {D} ;
  \tkzMarkAngle[size = 0.2cm,mark = |](b,e,a)
  \tkzMarkAngle[size = 0.3cm,mark = ||](c,e,b)
  \tkzMarkAngle[size = 0.2cm,mark = |](d,e,c)
  \tkzMarkAngle[size = 0.3cm,mark = ||](a,e,d)
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


Here, the two angles with a single hash mark are equal, and the two angles with 
double hash marks are equal.

When two lines are perpendicular, the angle between them is $90^\circ$, and we 
say they meet at a \emph{right angle}. When drawing diagrams, we indicate right
angles with an elbow:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
  \coordinate (a) at (0, 1.5);
  \coordinate (b) at (0, 0);
  \coordinate (c) at (1.5, 0);
  \draw [->](b)--(a)  ;
  \draw [->](b)--(c)  ;
  \pic [draw,thick,angle eccentricity=.5]{right angle = a--b--c};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

 
When an angle is less than $90^\circ$, it is said to be
\emph{acute}. When an angle is more than $90^\circ$, it is said to be
\emph{obtuse}.

Just as two angles which add up to $180^\circ$ are referred to as supplementary angles,
two (or more) angles which add up to $90^\circ$ are \emph{complementary} angles.\index{complementary angles} For example, 2 $45^\circ$ angles are complementary, as well as $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$. If an angle is $65^\circ$ degrees, we say that its \emph{complement} is $90^\circ-65^\circ=25^\circ$.

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  \coordinate (a) at (0.4, 0.6);
  \coordinate (b) at (0, 0);
  \coordinate (c) at (0.9, 0);
  \draw [->](b)--(a)  ;
  \draw [->](b)--(c)  ;
  \pic [draw, <->, "acute", angle radius = 1cm, angle eccentricity=1.5] {
  angle = c--b--a};

  \pic [draw, <->, "obtuse", angle radius = 0.6cm, angle eccentricity=1.5] {
  angle = a--b--c};

If two lines are parallel (never intersecting lines with points all the same distance apart), line segments that intersect both lines form the 
same angles with each line:

\section{Radians}
As you've seen above, angles can be measured in degrees. Just like you can 
measure length in more than one unit (inches, meters, etc.), there is more 
than one unit to measure angles in. Angles can also be measured in \textit{
radians}\index{radians}. Radians are unitless (that is, you don't have to put 
a letter after the number) and there are $\pi$ radians across a straight line. 
On diagrams and equations, unknown angles in radians are usually represented with the greek letter $\theta$.
This means $180^\circ$ is the same as $\pi$ radians. 
Radians come from comparing the length of an arc to the radius of a circle--which we will explore in a future chapter.

Generally, you can use the following formula for your conversions:
$${\displaystyle {\text{angle in degrees}}={\text{angle in radians}}\cdot {\frac {180^{\circ }}{\pi }}}$$

\textbf{Example}: An angle is measured to be $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians. What is 
the angle in degrees?

\textbf{Solution}: Since we know that $\pi$ radians is the same as $180^\circ$,
we can set up the unit conversion:
$$\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 90^\circ$$

Therefore, a $\frac{\pi}{2}$ angle is $90^\circ$.
