\chapter{Work and Energy}

In this chapter, we are going to talk about how engineers define work
and energy. It frequently takes force to get work done. Let's start with thinking 
about the relationship between force and energy. As we learned earlier, Force is 
measured in newtons, and one newton is equal to the force necessary to accelerate 
one kilogram at a rate of $1 m/s^2$.

When you lean on a wall, you are exerting a force on the wall, but you
aren't doing any work. On the other hand, if you push a car for a mile,
you are clearly doing work, as in Figure~\ref{fig:workvsforce}. Work, to an engineer, is the force you
apply to something, as well as the distance that something moves, in the direction
of the applied force. We measure work in \textit{joules}. A joule is one
newton of force applied over one meter.\index{Joule}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{workvsforce.png}
    \caption{Pushing on a wall does no work while pushing a car does work! Why?}
    \label{fig:workvsforce}
\end{figure}


For example, if you push a car with a force of 10 newtons for 12
meters, you have done 120 joules of work.\index{work}

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Formula for Work}]
If a force applied is \emph{constant}, the formulas for work is:
\[
W = F \cdot d
\]

where $W$ is the work in joules (N$\cdot$ m), $F$ is the \textit{force} in newtons, and $d$ is 
the distance in meters.

If the force is not in the same direction as the distance, we can use the cosine 
of the angle between the force and the distance:
\[
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the distance.
If the formula for work is \emph{not constant}, the formula becomes:
\[W = \int \textbf{F} \cdot \textbf{dr}\] where \textbf{dr} is an infinitesimal amount of displacement. An example of this kind of force is like a spring force, where the force varies with displacement.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{Exercise}[label=work1, title={Book done by a constant force}]
	\emph{This question is from an AP Physics C Review Book.}
	You slowly lift a 2 kg book at a \emph{constant velocity} through a distance of 3 m. How much work is done on the book?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=work1]
	In the case, the force you exert must balance the weight of the book, so $F=mg=2(9.8)= 19.6 N$. 
	Since this force is straight upward and the displacement is in the same direction, $W = F\cdot d = 19.6 \cdot 3 = 59.8 \, \text{J}$.
\end{Answer}

The work-energy theorem (or work-energy principle) states that the net work done 
on an object is equal to the \textbf{change in its energy}. In other 
words, if you do work on an object, you are changing its energy. This is 
derived from Newton's second law of motion, covered in Chapter~\ref{chap:heat}. 

\[
W = \Delta E 
\]

Work is how energy is transferred from one thing to another. When you push the 
car, you also burn sugars (energy of the body) in your blood. That energy is then
transferred to the car after it has been pushed uphill.

Thus, we measure the energy something consumes or generates in units of work: 
joules, kilowatt-hours, horsepower-hours, foot-pounds, BTUs (British Thermal 
Unit), and calories.

Let's go over a few different forms that energy can take.

\section{Forms of Energy}\index{energy!Forms of}

In this section we are going to learn about several different types of energy:
\begin{itemize}
\item Heat
\item Electricity
\item Chemical Energy
\item Kinetic Energy
\item Gravitational Potential Energy
\end{itemize}

There are also other forms of energy such as spring potential energy, which we will cover in the oscillations chapter.
\subsection{Heat}\index{heat}

When you heat something, you are transferring energy to it. The BTU is a common 
unit for heat. One BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 
one pound of water by one degree. One BTU is about 1,055 joules. In fact, when 
you buy and sell natural gas as fuel, it is priced by the BTU.\index{heat} \index{BTU}

When we talk about heat energy, we will commonly be talking about \emph{friction}. When a force does frictional work, it is output onto as a change in heat energy within the system. 

\subsection{Electricity}\index{electricity}

Electricity is the movement of electrons. When you push electrons through a space 
that resists their passage (like a light bulb), energy is transferred from the 
power source (like a battery) into the source of the resistance.

Let's say your lightbulb consumes 60 \newterm{watts} of electricity, and you leave it on 
for 24 hours. We would say that you have consumed 1.44 kilowatt hours, or 
3,600,000 joules. This comes into play when rating house electricity systems, lightbulbs, or electric cars. The electric energy stored in a battery of an electric car gets converted to kinetic energy and thermal energy taken out by friction.


\subsection{Chemical Energy}\index{chemical energy}

As mentioned earlier, some chemical reactions consume energy and some produce 
energy. This means energy can be stored in the structure of a molecule. When a 
plant uses photosynthesis to rearrange water and carbon dioxide into a sugar 
molecule, it converts the energy in the sunlight (solar energy) into chemical 
energy. Remember that photosynthesis is a process that consumes energy. 
Therefore, the sugar molecule has more chemical energy than the carbon dioxide 
and water molecules that were used in its creation.

Recall the balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
\[
6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2
\]

In our diet, we measure this energy in \textit{kilocalories}. A calorie is the 
energy necessary to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius, and is about 
4.19 joules. This is a very small unit. An apple has about 100,000 calories (100 
kilocalories), so people working with food started measuring everything in kilocalories.\index{calories}

(You may find it helpful that the chapter on unit conversions appears earlier in this text, so that the calorie-joule relationship can be placed in proper context.) %FIXME link if possible to workbook one chapter ?? whatever unit conversions is.

Here is where things get tricky: People who work with food got tired of saying 
``kilocalories'', so they just started using ``Calorie'' to mean 1,000 calories. 
This has created a great deal of confusion over the years. So if the C is capitalized,
 ``Calorie'' probably means kilocalorie.

\subsection{Kinetic Energy}\index{kinetic energy}
A mass in motion has energy. For example, if you are in a moving car and you slam
on the brakes, the energy from the motion of the car is converted into heat in
the brake pads and under the tires. This stored energy of motion is known as
\emph{kinetic energy}.

But how much energy does a moving object actually have?

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Formula for Kinetic Energy}]
\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]
where $KE$ is the kinetic energy in joules, $m$ is the mass in kilograms, and
$v$ is the speed in meters per second.
\end{mdframed}

This equation tells us two important things:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Kinetic energy increases \emph{linearly} with mass. A heavier object has
  more energy at the same speed.
  \item Kinetic energy increases \emph{quadratically} with velocity. This means
  that doubling the speed results in \emph{four times} the kinetic energy.
\end{itemize}

Why does the velocity term appear squared? One way to understand this is to consider the work required to accelerate an object. To speed something up, a force must act over a distance. As the object moves faster, each additional meter of acceleration takes less time but still increases the kinetic energy significantly. The mathematical result of this relationship is the $v^2$ dependence. Kinetic energy ultimately tells us how powerful an object is. Real life calculations involve calculating car crash preventions, motor speeds, rocket propulsions, battery requirements, and gyroscopic forces.

\begin{Exercise}[title={Kinetic and Thermal Energy}, label=energyBrakingCar]
  A $1,200 \text{ kg}$ car traveling at $22 \text{m/s}$ comes to a stop using its brakes.
  Assume all the initial kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy in the brakes and tires.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item How much thermal energy, $Q$ is produced?
    \item If the break system has a $15 \text{ kg}$ and a specific heat of $c = 460 (J/kg^ \circ C)$, estimate the temperature increase of the brakes.
  \end{enumerate}
  Also, you are given that the change in heat, $\Delta T = \frac{Q}{m_{brake}c}$.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=energyBrakingCar]
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Since all kinetic energy is transferred into thermal energy, we can say:
    \[Q = KE = \frac{1}{2}(1200)(22)^2 = 290,400 \text{ J}\]
    \item The rise in heat is given by $\Delta T = \dfrac{Q}{mc} = \frac{290,400}{15 \times 460} \approx 42^\circ \text{ C}$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}
\subsection{Gravitational Potential Energy}\index{potential energy!gravitational}


When you lift something heavy onto a shelf, you are giving it \textit{potential energy}. The amount of energy that you transferred to it is proportional to its 
weight and the height that you lifted it.

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Formula for Gravitational Potential Energy}]
The formula for gravitational potentional energy is

\[
E = mgh
\]

where $E$ is the energy in joules, $m$ is the mass of the object you
lifted, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height that you lifted it.

On earth, then, gravitational potential energy is given by

\[
E = (9.8)mh
\]

since objects in free-fall near Earth's surface accelerate at $9.8 m/s^2$.

\end{mdframed}


There are various kinds of potential energy. For example, when you draw a bow in 
order to fire an arrow, you have given that bow potential energy. When you release it, the potential energy is transferred to the arrow, which expresses it as kinetic energy. When you compress a spring, the energy put into the spring is proportional to the spring constant and distance it is compressed, $\frac{1}{2} kx^2$. We will dive deeper into this in the springs and oscillations chapter.


\section{Conservation of Energy}

The first law of thermodynamics says ``Energy is neither created nor destroyed.''
\index{energy!conservation of}

Energy can change forms. Your cells consume chemical energy to give gravitational potential energy to a car you push up a hill. A falling bject converts potential energy into kinetic energy, causing it to speed up. However, the total amount of energy in a closed system stays constant. 

The sum of mechanical energy (usually Kinetic and Potential) is always constant:
\[
W_\text{net,ext}=\Delta E_\text{sys}=\Delta K+\Delta U+\Delta E_\text{th}
\]
Choosing a specific system or environment will benefit your problem, especially if the net external work done is $0$. Problems that involve energy transformation are similar to accounting problems, the work before and after must be equal, and must equal some constant net value.

\begin{Exercise}[title={The Energy of Falling}, label=energy_falling]

A 5 kg cannonball falls off the top of a 3 meter ladder. As it falls, its 
gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. How fast is 
the cannonball traveling just before it hits the floor?

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=energy_falling]

  At the top of the ladder, the cannonball has $(9.8)(5)(3) = 147 \text{ J}$ of potential energy.

  At the bottom, the kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}(5)v^2$ must be equal
  to 147 joules. So $v^2 = \frac{294}{5}$.  This means it is going about
  $7.7 \text{ m/s}$.

  (You may be wondering about air resistance. Yes, a tiny amount of energy is 
  lost to air resistance, but for a dense object moving at these relatively slow 
  speeds, this energy is negligible.)

\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[title=Frictional Losses, label =slidingblockfriction]
  A $4.0 \text{ kg}$ block is released from rest at the top of a rough incline of height $2.5 \text{ m}$.
  By the time it reaches the bottom, its speed is $4.2 \text{ m/s}$. 

  Determine the total mechanical energy lost to thermal energy.

  You may use $10 \text{ m/s}^2$ for g
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=slidingblockfriction]
The initial total gravitational potential energy is $mgh = 4(10)(2.5) = 100 \text{ J}$. The finial kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(4)(4.2)^2 = 35.28$. So, the rest of the energy must be lost due to friction: $100 - 35.28 = 64.72 \text{ J}$. 
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[title=Blast Off!, label=rocketsled]
  A rocket sled of mass $150 \text{ kg}$ uses a small fuel-powered booster that releases $1.2\times 10^5\,\text{J}$ of chemical energy. During the burn, $65\%$ of the energy is converted into useful kinetic energy for the sled, the rest is lost as heat or sound. Assume the sled travels on frictionless, smooth surface.

  Calculate the final speed of the rocket sled.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=rocketsled]
The total useful energy can be calculated as $0.65(1.2\times 10^5) = 7.8\times 10^4\,\text{J}$. Then, we can set the final KE $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 7.8\times 10^4$ and solve for $v$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{2}(150)v^2 &= 7.8\times 10^4\\
  (150)v^2 &= 15.6 \times 10^4 \\ 
  v^2 &=1,040 \\ 
  v&\approx32.249 \text{ m/s}
\end{align*}
\end{Answer}

\section{Work and Kinetic Energy}
As stated above, the work-energy theorem tells us that the change in an object's 
kinetic energy is equal to the work done on that object. For now, we will only 
consider examples where the force and the direction of motion are parallel or 
perpendicular. When you learn about vectors, we will expand this to include 
forces that are skew to the direction of motion. 

Consider what happens when you toss a ball in the air: once the ball leaves your 
hand, the only force acting on it is gravity. Initially, the ball is moving 
upwards while gravity points downwards:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[blue, fill=blue] (0,0) circle (0.5cm);
        \draw[->, very thick, red] (0, 0.5) -- (0, 1.25) node[above, black] 
        {$v$ $\left( \frac{m}{s} \right)$};
        \draw[->, very thick, red] (0, -0.5) -- (0, -1.25) node[below, black] 
        {$F_g$ $\left( N \right)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Intuitively, we know that the ball will slow down (lose kinetic energy) as it 
moves upwards:

$$\Delta KE < 0$$

Since $W = \Delta KE$, we also know that gravity must be doing \textit{negative 
work}. Whenever the direction of the force is opposite the direction of the 
motion, the work done by that force is negative. 
\begin{Exercise}[title=A ball thrown upwards, label=ball_energy]
If the ball has a mass of 0.5 kg, how much kinetic energy does it lose as it moves upwards by 1 m?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=ball_energy]
The force acting on the ball is its weight, $F_w = mg$, and we 
will designate this as negative since weight points downwards. Using the 
work-energy theorem, 

$$\Delta KE = F \cdot d = \left( mg \right) \cdot d = \left( 0.5 kg \right) \left(
-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2} \right) \left( 1 m \right) = -4.9 J$$

Therefore, the ball loses 4.9 joules of kinetic energy for every 1 meter it moves 
upwards (the fact it is \textit{losing kinetic energy} is represented by the 
result being negative). Note that this is also the formula for potential energy, so it gained 4.9 J of potential energy.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[title = {How far will you slide?}, label = slide]
You are playing softball and have to slide into home. If you sprint at a maximum 
of 10 m/s and the force of friction between you and the ground is 0.3 times your 
weight, how far from the base can you start your slide and still reach home?
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = slide]
$$F_f \cdot d = \Delta KE = KE_f - KE_i$$

You'll reach the maximum distance you can slide when you stop moving, so we will 
use a final velocity of zero, which means a final kinetic energy of zero:
$$F_f \cdot d = -KE_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Since the force of friction is 0.3 times your weight, we know that:
$$F_f = 0.3 F_w = 0.3mg$$

Substituting and canceling the mass:
$$\left( 0.3 mg \right) \cdot d = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$0.3g \cdot d = \frac{1}{2}v^2$$

Since we know g and v, we can solve for d:
$$d = \frac{v^2}{0.6g} = \frac{\left( 10 \frac{m}{s} \right)^2}{0.6 \left( 9.8 
\frac{m}{s^2} \right)} \approx 1.7 m$$

So, if you want to reach home base, you should start your slide no more than 
1.7 m from home. 
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[title = {Ranking Stopping Force}, label = stop]
In drag racing, cars can reach speeds of 150 miles per hour (approximately 240 
kilometers per hour). In order to be able to stop quickly and safely, drag 
racing cars are built with parachutes that deploy at the end of the race. 
Consider a drag race where cars of different masses reach different maximum 
speeds. There is 100 meters between the finish line and the fence surrounding 
the race track. If all the race cars deploy their parachutes at the finish line 
while going their maximum speed, rank the force needed from the parachute to 
stop each car in the required distance from least to greatest:

\begin{Answer}[ref = stop]
Since all the cars need to stop in the same distance, the cars with the 
greatest kinetic energy will take the most force to stop. Calculating the 
kinetic energies (we won't change the units from kilometers per hour to meters 
per second, since we're just comparing the values):

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
	Car & Mass [kg] & Max speed [kph] & KE [kg $(kph)^2$]\\\hline
	A & 2000 & 100 & $1 \times 10^7$\\\hline
	B & 2400 & 120 & $1.728 \times 10^7$\\\hline
	C & 3200 & 240 & $9.216 \times 10^7$\\\hline
	D & 2400 & 140 & $2.352 \times 10^7$\\\hline
	E & 3200 & 120 & $2.304 \times 10^7$\\\hline
	F & 2000 & 240 & $5.67 \times 10^7$\\\hline

The correct ranking is A, B, E, D, F, C.

\subsection{Forces that do no work}
If the object you are pushing doesn't move. or the applied force is perpendicular 
to the direction of motion, that force does no work. Let's look at a few examples:

\subsubsection{Pushing Against an Immobile Object}
At the beginning of the chapter, we said that when you push on a wall, you don't 
do any work. Why is this? Well, if the wall is a good wall (that is, strong 
enough to not be pushed over by a person), the wall won't move while you push on 
it. This means the distance over which your push is applied is zero, and 
therefore the work done ($F \cdot d = F \cdot 0 = 0$) is zero joules.

\subsubsection{Walking Across a Room with a Book}
Imagine holding a book flat on your hands and walking at a constant velocity. 
Your hand is applying an upwards force to the book, but the book is moving 
horizontally. This means the force and direction of motion are 
\textit{perpendicular}. Recall from the beginning of the chapter than if the 
force and distance are not parallel, then the work is given by $W = F \cdot d 
\cos{\left( \theta \right)}$. (When the vectors are parallel, $\theta = 0$ and 
$\cos{\left( \theta \right)} = 1$, while when the vectors point in opposite 
directions, $\theta = 180^{\circ}$ and $\cos{ \left( \theta \right)} = -1$.) 
When the vectors are perpendicular, then $\theta = 90^{\circ}$ and $\cos{ \left( 
\theta \right)} = 0$. Therefore, $W = 0$ as well and the upward force of your 
hands does no net work. 

\subsubsection{Circular Motion}
We will discuss circular motion further in a subsequent chapter. For now, know 
that constant-speed circular motion is caused by a constant-magnitude force that 
always points to the center of the circle the object is moving in. For example, 
you can take a weight on the end of a string and spin it. The tension in the 
string spins the weight, and the string always points from the object to your 
hand (the center of the weight's circular path). For a satellite, that force is 
gravitational attraction to the Earth.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{satellite.png}
\end{center}

As a result, the force changes the \textit{direction}, but not the 
\textit{magnitude} of the satellite's velocity. Let's re-examine the equation 
for kinetic energy:

$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Since the velocity is squared, the direction of motion doesn't affect the kinetic 
energy (a ball moving at 5 m/s upwards has the same kinetic energy as if the ball 
were moving at 5 m/s downwards). So, a force that causes circular motion doesn't 
change a circling object's kinetic energy, and therefore does no work (as 
expected when force and direction of motion are perpendicular)!

\section{Efficiency and Power}
Although energy is always conserved as it moves through different forms, 
scientists aren't always that good at controlling it.\index{efficiency}

In terms of an equation, efficiency is the ratio of the useful energy output to 
the total energy input. It is usually expressed as a percentage.
\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Formula for Efficiency}]
\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful Energy Output}}{\text{Total Energy Input}} 
\times 100\%
\]
\end{mdframed}
where the useful energy output is the energy that is actually used to do work or 
complete a task, and the total energy input is the total energy consumed by the 
system.

A machine is considered 100\% efficient only if all the input work is converted 
into useful output work, with no energy lost to heat, friction, or sound. 100\% 
efficient process don't exist in real-life: every process loses some useful 
energy to heat. 

For example, when a car engine consumes the chemical energy in gasoline, only
about 20\% of the energy consumed is used to turn the wheels. Most of the energy 
is actually lost as heat. If you run a car for a while, the engine gets very hot, 
as does the exhaust coming from the tailpipe.

A human is about 25\% efficient. Most of the loss is in the heat produced during 
the chemical reactions that turns food into motion.
% ADD: Cellular Respiration

In general, if you are trying to increase efficiency in any system, the solution 
is usually easy to identify by the heat that is produced. Reduce the heat, increase 
the efficiency.

Light bulbs are an interesting case. To get the same amount of light of a 60 watt 
incandescent bulb, you can use an 8 watt LED or a 16 watt fluorescent light. This 
is why we say that the LED light is much more efficient. If you run both, the 
incandescent bulb will consume 1.44 kilowatt-hours; the LED will consume only 
0.192 kilowatt-hours. 

In addition to light, the incandescent bulb is producing a lot of heat. If it
is inside your house, what happens to the heat? It warms your house.

In the winter, when you want light and heat, the incandescent bulb is
100\% efficient!

Of course, this also means the reverse is true. In the summer, if you are running 
the air conditioner to cool down your house, the incandescent bulb is worse than 
just ``inefficient at making light'' --- it is actually counteracting the air 
conditioner!

\begin{Exercise}[title=Unit Costs, label=efficiency1]
A machine is rated to produce 500 bolts per hour, but in actual operation it runs at only $82\%$ efficiency due to loss and scraps.
The machine requires \mathdollar 24 of electricity per hour to run.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item What is the actual output of bolts per hour?
  \item What is the unit cost (cost per bolt) of the production?
\end{enumerate}

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=efficiency1]
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $500 \times 0.82 = 410 \text{ bolts}$
    \item $\frac{\mathdollar24}{410} \approx \mathdollar 0.06$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

Another measure of Work and Energy is \emph{Power}. Power is the rate at which work gets done (or energy gets transferred). Suppose I do work in 1000 J of work in 10 minutes but you do the same amount of work in 5 minutes. Because you did the same amount of work but in a quick amount of time, you were more \emph{powerful}.

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Formula for Power}]
	\[\text{Power} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Time}} \implies P = \frac{W}{t}\]
  Power is represented by the unit watt ($\text{W}$), defined as one joule per second ($\text{J/s}$).
	Since power is a rate, we can also express it using calculus:
	\[P=\frac{dW}{dt}\]

	Equivallently, for work done by constant forces, this simplifies to $P=\frac{F \cdot r}{t} = F \cdot v$, since 
\end{mdframed}

Power is measured in the unit \textbf{watt}, where one watt is one Joule per second: $1 \text{W} = 1 \, \text{J}/\text{s}$

%CONSTNANT FORCE
\begin{Exercise}[title=Hydraulic Piston Problem,label=power1]
A hydraulic piston pushes a crate horizontally across the floor with a constant force of 450 N.
During operation, the piston moves the crate 1.8 meters in 0.75 seconds.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item How much work does the piston do on the crate?
  \item What is the power output of the piston during this motion?
\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=power1]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item $$W = F\cdot d = 450 \cdot  1.8 =810 \text{ J}$$
  \item $$P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{810}{.75} = 1080 \text{ W}$$
  Alternatively,
  $$v = \frac{d}{t} = \frac{1.8}{0.75} = 2.4\ \text{m/s}$$
  $$P = F\cdot v = 450 \cdot 2.4 = 1080 \text{ W}$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

%VARIABLE FORCE
\begin{Exercise}[title=Spring Power, label=power2]
A compressed spring launches a small block. The spring delivers $120$ W of power while releasing its stored energy over $0.40$ seconds. The spring constant is $k = 800$ N/m.

How far was the spring compressed?
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=power2]
\begin{align*}
  P &= \frac{E}{t} \\
  E &= P\cdot t = 120 (0.4) = 48 \text{ J}
  &= 48 J
\end{align*}
So 48 J of energy is stored into the spring. We can find the spring's PE converted to distance by:
\begin{align*}
  E &= \frac{1}{2}kx^2\\
  48 &= \frac{1}{2}(800)x^2 \\
  x^2 &= \frac{48}{400} \\ 
  x &= \sqrt{0.12} \approx 0.346 \text{ m}
\end{align*}
So the spring had to have been compressed 34.6 cm.
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[title=Elevator Lift, label = elevatorPE]
An elevator motor lifts a $750 \text{ kg}$ cabin vertically upward a distance of $18 \text{ m}$ in $12 \text{ s}$. The motor consumes electrical energy at a rate of 
$18 \text{ kW}$. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Compute the total electrical energy consumed during the lift. Note that $1 \text{ kW} = 1000 \text{ watts} = 1000 \text{ J/s}$
  \item Determine the gravitational potential energy gained by the elevator.
  \item Calculate the efficiency of the motor during this lift.
\end{enumerate}

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=elevatorPE]
  
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Electrical energy input can be calculated as $E= Pt = 18 \text{ kW} \times 1000 \text{ J/s} \times 12 \text{ sec} = 216,000 \text{ J}$. 
  \item The elevator travels $18 \text{ m}$ upwards, so the total gravitational potential energy is $mgh = 750(9.8)(18) = 132,300 \text{ J}$. 
  \item The efficiency can be calculated as $\frac{\text{Useful Output}}{\text{Total Input}} = \frac{132,000}{216,000} \approx 61.1\%$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}
