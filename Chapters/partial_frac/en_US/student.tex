\chapter{Partial Fractions}

How can you add fractions with different denominators, like $\frac{1}{x} + 
\frac{2}{x + 3}$? You would need to make the denominators the same; after that, you 
could just add the numerators. You achieve this by multiplying the numerator 
and denominator of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction:
$$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x + 3} = \frac{1}{x} \left( \frac{x + 3}{x + 3} 
\right) + \frac{2}{x + 3} \left( \frac{x}{x} \right)$$

Recall that when the numerator and denominator of a fraction are the same, the 
fraction is equal to one. So, we are not changing the \textit{value} of each 
fraction, since we are just multiplying by one. Continuing, we can perform the 
multiplication and see that:
$$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x + 3} = \frac{x + 3}{x(x + 3)} + \frac{2x}{x(x + 3)}$$
$$= \frac{(x + 3) + 2x}{x(x + 3)} = \frac{3x + 3}{x^2 + 3x} = \frac{3(x + 1)}{x
^2 + 3x}$$

The inverse of this process is called \textbf{partial fraction decomposition} 
(or partial fraction expansion)\index{partial fraction decomposition}. This 
method has applications in many fields, but we will find it most useful as a 
tool to evaluate integrals in a later chapter. 


Let $g(x)$ be a rational function such that 
$$g(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$
Where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials. If $g(x)$ is proper (that is, the 
degree of $P$ is less than the degree of $Q(x)$ then we can express $g(x)$ as 
the sum of simpler rational fractions. If $g(x)$ is improper (that is, the 
degree of $P$ is greater than or equal to the degree of $Q$), then we must 
first perform long division to obtain a remainder, $R(x)$, where the degree 
of $R$ is less than the degree of $Q$:
$$g(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = S(x) + \frac{R(x)}{Q(x)}$$

\subsection{Improper fractions}
What is $\int \frac{x^3 + x}{x-1}\,dx$. Using long division, we see that:
$$\frac{x^3 + x}{x - 1} = x^2 + x + 2 + \frac{2}{x - 1}$$
(see figure \ref{polylongdiv} for an explanation). Then we can also say that:
$$\frac{x^3 + x}{x-1} = x^2 + x + 2 + \frac{2}{x-1}$$

When you start with an improper fraction, use long division to reduce it to a 
term plus a proper fraction, then use the methods outlined below to further 
manipulate the proper fraction. 

\begin{Exercise}[label = improper]
Use long division to reduce the following improper rational functions to a 
term plus a proper rational fraction.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x - 3}{x^2 - 3x + 2}$
\item $\frac{2x^3 + 5}{x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 4}$
\item $\frac{3x^4 - 2x^3 - x^2 + 1}{x^3 - 3x}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = improper]
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x^2 + 4x + 12 \frac{30x - 27}{x^2 - 3x + 2}$
\item $2 + \frac{6x^2 - 4x + 13}{x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 4}$
\item $3x - 2 + \frac{8x^2 - 6x + 1}{x^3 - 3x}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

\subsection{Proper fractions}
When the order of the numerator is less than or equal to the denominator, 
there are three further possibilities. 

\subsubsection{No repeated linear factors}
In the first case, the denominator, $Q(x)$ is composed of distinct linear 
factors. In this case, we can say that $Q(x) = (a_1x + b_1)(a_2x + b_2) \cdots 
(a_nx + b_n)$, where no factor is repeated (including constant multiples). 
Then, there exists $A, B, C, \cdots$, such that:
$$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \frac{A}{a_1x+b_1} + \frac{B}{a_2x + b_2} + \cdots$$

Let's see an example of this by decomposing $\frac{4x^2 - 7x - 12}{x (x + 2) (x 
- 3)}$. We start by defining $A$, $B$, and $C$, such that:
$$\frac{4x^2 - 7x - 12}{x (x + 2) (x - 3)} = \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x + 2} + 
\frac{C}{x - 3}$$
Multiplying both sides by $x (x + 2) (x - 3)$ we get:
$$4x^2 - 7x - 12 = A(x + 2)(x - 3) + B(x)(x - 3) + C(x)(x + 2)$$
We have 3 unknowns and only one equation! Don't worry --- remember this equation 
is true for all $x$, so we can choose a convenient value of $x$ to isolate 
each unknown in turn. Starting, let $x = 0$. Then:
$$4(0)^2 - 7(0) - 12 = A(0 + 2)(0 - 3) + B(0)(x - 3) + C(0)(x + 2)$$
$$-12 = A(2)(-3) + 0 + 0$$
Notice that the $B$ and $C$ disappear, and we can solve for $A$:
$$A = \frac{-12}{-6} = 2$$
We can solve for $B$ by setting $x = -2$ and for $C$ by setting $x = 3$ 
(notice, we've used all three zeroes of the denominator polynomial):
$$4(-2)^2 - 7(-2) - 12 = A(-2 + 2)(-2 - 3) + B(-2)(-2 - 3) + C(-2)(-2 + 2)$$
$$4(4) + 14 - 12 = 0 + B(-2)(-5) + 0$$
$$16 + 2 = 10B$$
$$B = \frac{9}{5}$$
and
$$4(3)^2 - 7(3) - 12 = A(3 + 2)(3 - 3) + B(3)(3 - 3) + C(3)(3 + 2)$$
$$4(9) - 21 - 12 = 0 + 0 + C(3)(5)$$
$$36 - 33 = 15C$$
$$C = \frac{1}{5}$$
We can then decompose our original fraction:
$$\frac{4x^2 - 7x - 12}{x (x + 2) (x - 3)} = \frac{2}{x} + \frac{9}{5(x + 2)} 
+ \frac{1}{5(x - 3)}$$
You can check your answer by cross-multiplying and adding. You should get the 
same rational function back. 

\subsubsection{Repeated linear factors}
The second case is if $Q(x)$ has repeated factors (such as $x^2 + 8x + 16 = (x 
+ 4)^2$). Suppose the first linear factor, $(a_1x + b_1)$ is repeated $r$ 
times (that is, $Q(x)$ contains the factor $(a_1x + b_1)^r$). Then, instead of 
$\frac{A}{a_1x + b_1}$, we should write:
$$\frac{A_1}{a_1x + b_1} + \frac{A_2}{(a_1x + b_1)^2} + \cdots + \frac{A_r}{(
a_1x + b_1)^r}$$
Let's look at a concrete example to see how this works:

\textbf{Example}: Decompose $\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{(x + 1)^2 (x + 2)}$

\textbf{Solution}: We start by defining:
$$\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{(x + 1)^2 (x + 2)} = \frac{A}{x + 1} + \frac{B}{(x + 1)^
2} + \frac{C}{x + 2}$$
Multiplying both sides by $(x + 1)^2 (x + 2)$:
$$x^2 + x + 1 = A(x + 1)(x + 2) + B(x + 2) + C(x + 1)^2$$
Since there are only 2 roots to $(x + 1)^2 (x + 2)$, we will use another 
method called ''equating the coefficients" to find $A$, $B$, and $C$. We start 
by expanding the right side of the equation:
$$x^2 + x + 1 = A(x^2 + 3x + 2) + B(x + 2) + C(x^2 + 2x + 1)$$
Distributing and combining, we find that:
$$x^2 + x + 1 = Ax^2 + 3Ax + 2A + Bx + 2B + Cx^2 + 2Cx + C$$
$$x^2 + x + 1 = (A + C)x^2 + (3A + B + 2C)x + (2A + 2B + C)$$
For this equation to be true, we know that:
$$A + C = 1$$
$$3A + B + 2C = 1$$
$$2A + 2B + C = 1$$
(That is, the coefficient for $x^2$ on the left, 1, must be equal to the 
coefficient for $x^2$ on the right, (A + C), and so on.) We now have a system 
of 3 equations and 3 unknowns. When you solve for each, you should find that:
$$A = -2$$
$$B = 1$$
$$C = 3$$
Therefore, 
$$\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{(x + 1)^2 (x + 2)} = \frac{-2}{x + 1} + \frac{1}{(x + 1)^
2} + \frac{3}{x + 2}$$

\subsubsection{Irreducible quadratic factors}
Sometimes, we cannot express a polynomial as the product of two linear 
statements (that is, terms in the form $ax + b$). Take $x^2 + 1$, which 
cannot be expressed as the product of real, linear terms. What do you do 
if something like $x^2 + 1$ is in the denominator? In this case, when we write an 
expression for $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, we include a term in the form:
$$\frac{Ax + B}{ax^2 + bx + c}$$
For example, we can write:
$$\frac{x}{(x - 2)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 4)} = \frac{A}{x - 2} + \frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 1} 
+ \frac{Dx + E}{x^2 + 4}$$

\textbf{Example}: Decompose $\frac{2x^2 - x + 4}{x^3 + 4x}$

\textbf{Solution}: We begin by factoring the denominator:
$$x^3 + 4x = x(x^2 + 4)$$
Which cannot be factored further. Therefore, we define:
$$\frac{2x^2 - x + 4}{x(x^2 + 4)} = \frac{A}{x} + \frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 4}$$
$$2x^2 - x + 4 = A(x^2 + 4) + (Bx + C)x$$
$$2x^2 - x + 4 = Ax^2 + 4A + Bx^2 + Cx$$
Which implies that:
$$2 = A + B$$
$$C = -1$$
$$4A = 4$$
Therefore, $A = 1$, $B = 1$, and $C = -1$ and we can say that:
$$\frac{2x^2 - x + 4}{x^3 + 4x} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{x - 1}{x^2 + 4}$$

\subsubsection{Repeated irreducible quadratic factors}
Lastly, the denominator might contain repeated irreducible quadratic factors. 
Similar to repeated linear factors, when setting up your partial fractions, 
instead of only writing 
$$\frac{A}{ax^2 + bx + c}$$
For a quadratic factor that is repeated $r$ times, your equation should include:
$$\frac{A_1}{ax^2 + bx + c} + \frac{A_2}{(ax^2 + bx + c)^2} + \cdots + 
\frac{A_r}{(ax^2 + bx + c)^r}$$
