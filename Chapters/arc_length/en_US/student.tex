\section{Determining the Arc Length of a Curve}

Another application of integrals is finding the length of a curve. In 
real-life, we could do this by laying a piece of string up against 
the curve, then straightening out the string and measuring its length 
with a ruler (you may have done this is elementary school when you 
were first learning about the relationship between the radius and 
circumference of a circle). Archimedes estimated the circumference of 
a circle by inscribing a circle with polygons of increasing numbers 
of sides. (Archimedes' proof that $\pi$ is between $3 \frac{10}{71}$ 
and $3 \frac{1}{7}$ is more complicated but we won't dive into that 
here.) As we increase the number of sides of the inscribed polygon, 
the perimeter of the polygon (the sum of the lengths of the sides) 
gets closer to the circumference of the circle (see figure 
\ref{fig:circles}). Now, it's easy to find the length of a polygon: 
just add up the length of the line segments! Using this, we can find 
the length of a curve by approximating it as many short lines and 
adding up the lengths of those lines.

        \draw[black] (0,-5) circle (2cm);

        \draw[black] (5, -5) circle (2cm);
        \node[red, regular polygon, regular polygon sides = 12, draw, 
        inner sep=1.35cm] at (5, -5){};
         \node[font=\large] at (5, -5) {$n = 12$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{As $n$ increases, the perimeter of the inscribed polygon 
    approaches the circumference of the circle}
    \label{fig:circles}
\end{figure}

We can choose $n$ points along the graph of $f(x)$ and 
connect each point with a straight line (this is shown in figure 
\ref{fig:polygon}). If we add up the length of the lines, we get an 
estimate of the length of the curve. We represent the length of the 
line between the $i^{th}$ point, $P_i$ and the previous point, 
$P_{i-1}$ as $|P_{i-1}P_i|$ (recall that the absolute value sign can 
be used to signify the length of something). Therefore, the sum of 
the lengths of the lines approximating the curve is:
$$\sum_{i=1}^n |P_{i-1}P_i|$$

    \caption{As the number of points increases, the total length of the lines segments approaches the true length of the curve}
    \label{fig:points}
\end{figure}

The more points we choose, the closer the lines lay to the actual 
curve (see figure \ref{fig:points}), and the closer our estimate is 
to the true length. So, to find the true length, we will want to take 
$n$ to $\infty$. Therefore, the actual curve length is the limit as 
$n \to \infty$ of that sum:
$$L = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n |P_{i-1}P_i|$$

The length of each segment can be found using the Pythgorean theorem. 
Recall that the distance between two points on the $xy$-plane is 
$\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. (FIX ME ADD DIAGRAM) The 
coordinates of $P_{i-1}$ are $(x_{i-1}, f(x_{i-1}))$ and the 
coordinates of $P_i$ are $(x_i, f(x_i))$. Substituting this into the 
above sum, we see that the total length of the segments is 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x_i - x_{i-1})^2 + (f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1}))^2}$$

Recall the Mean Value Theorem, which states that there is some 
$x_i^{\text{*}}$ such that $f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1}) = f'(x_i^{\text{*}})
(x_i - x_{i-1})$. Substituting this into the above sum, we get: 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(x_i - x_{i-1})^2 + (f'(x_i^{\text{*}})(x_i - x_{i-1}))^2}$$ 
Recall from the chapter on Riemann sums and the integral that we 
defined $\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and we can further re-write the 
sum as $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + [f'(x_i^{\text{*}}) \Delta x]^2} 
= \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^{\text{*}})]^2}\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2} = 
\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i^{\text{*}})]^2}\Delta x$$

Putting this all together, we see that that actual length of the 
curve is defined as $$L = \lim_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{1+
[f'(x_i^{\text{*}})]^2}\Delta x$$

This is the definition of the integral of $\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}$ and 
therefore the length of some function $f(x)$ on the interval $a < x <b$ 
is $\int_a^b \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2}\,dx$.

\section{Arc Length of Vector-valued Functions}
Suppose you have a vector-valued function, $f(t) = [x(t), y(t)]$. A common example might be an artillery shell shot at an angle.

\section{Applications in Physics}
When we take the integral of a velocity function, we get the \textit{displacement}. For example, if you drove to school and home again, your displacement would be zero. However, the \textit{distance} you traveled is not zero! We can use the arc length formula to find the total distance traveled. (Remember, that if $s(t)$ is the object's position, the its velocity is given by $s'(t)$.

\begin{Exercise}[label=length1]
Write an integral that gives the length of the requested curve.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $y = \ln{x}$ from $x = 1$ to $x = 3$
	\item $y = \sin{x}$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \pi$
	\item $y = \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{1}{4x}$ from $x = 1$ to $x = 4$
	\item $y = \ln{\cos{x}}$ from $x = 0$ to $x = \frac{\pi}{3}$
	\end{enumerate}	 
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=length1]
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item $L = \int_{1}^{3} \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{x^2}}\,dx$
	\item $L = \int_{0}^{\pi} \sqrt{1 + \cos^2{x}}\,dx$
	\item $L = \int_{1}^{4} \sqrt{1 + (x^2-\frac{1}{4x^2})^2}\,dx$
	\item $L = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} \sqrt{1 + (\frac{1}{\cos{x}} 
	\times - \sin{x})^2}\,dx = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{3}} \sqrt{1 + 
	\tan^2{x}}\,dx$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[label=length2]
The arc length function for a curve $f(x)$, where $f$ is an increasing 
function, is given by $s(x) = \int_{0}^{x} \sqrt{3t + 5}\,dt$. If $f$ 
has $y$-intercept 2, find an equation for $f$. What point on $f$ is 
three units from the $y$-intercept? Give your answer to the thousandths 
place. 
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=length2]
From looking at the structure of the given arc length integral, we can 
see that $f'(x) = \sqrt{3x + 4}$. Taking the antiderivative, we find 
that $f(x) = \frac{2}{9}(3x + 4)^{3 / 2} + C$. Substituting $f(0) = 2$
, we can solve for $C$. $$2 = \frac{2}{9}(3(0) + 4)^{3 / 2} + C$$ 
$$2 = \frac{2}{9}(4)^{3 / 2} + C$$ 
$$2 = \frac{2}{9}(2)^3 + C$$ 
$$2 = \frac{16}{9} + C$$ 
$$\frac{18}{9} = \frac{16 + 9C}{9}$$ 
$$18 = 16 + 9C$$ 
$$2 = 9C$$ 
$$C = \frac{2}{9}$$\\ 
Therefore, $f(x) = \frac{2}{3}(3x + 4)^{3 / 2} + \frac{2}{9}$. To find 
the coordinate point where $s(x) = 3$, we first note that the 
antiderivative of $\sqrt{3t + 5}$ is $\frac{2}{9}(3t + 5)^{3 / 2} + C$. 
Therefore, $s(x) = \frac{2}{9}(3x + 5)^{3 / 2} - \frac{2}{9}(5)^{3 / 2}$. 
Setting $s(x) = 3$ and solving for $x$, we find that $x = 1.159$
\end{Answer}

\begin{Exercise}[label=length3]
	[This problem was originally presented as a no-calculator, 
	multiple-choice question on the 2012 AP Calculus BC exam.] Write an 
	integral that gives the length of the curve $ y = \ln{x}$ from 
	$x = 1$ to $x = 2$. 
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref=length3]
Recall that arc length is given by $\int_a^b \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2}\,dx$. 
Since $f(x) = \ln{x}$, then $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$. Taking $a = 1$, 
$b = 2$, and $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, the integral that gives the length 
of the curve $y = \ln{x}$ on the specified interval is $\int_1^2 
\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x^2}}\,dx$.
