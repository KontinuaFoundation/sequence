All things (including the air around you) are made of atoms. Atoms are
incredibly tiny --- there are more atoms in a drop of water than there are
drops of water in all the oceans.
% ADD: If you want a better visual of the scale: https://htwins.net/scale2/, start at around 10^-8

Every atom has a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons. Orbiting around the
nucleus is a cloud of electrons. However, the mass of the atom
comes mainly from the protons and neutrons, since they are about 2000 times as
massive as an electron! These three particles, protons, neutrons, and
electrons, are called \textit{subatomic particles}. (See figure \ref{fig:atom1}.)

\section{Models of the Atom}
Over the history of science, there have been many ideas about the structure of
atoms. This history is a good example of how science develops: unexpected
results drive scientists to update their models, moving us closer and closer to
a true model of the atom.

During his investigations into the behavior of gases,
John Dalton noted that different elements combine in strict
ratios. For example, he noted that nitrogen and oxygen combine in a 1:1 and 1:2
fashion, but no ratio in between.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=2.5in, trim={0 0.5cm 0 0.5cm}, clip=true]{daltons_model.png}
\caption{Dalton modeled atoms as indivisible and unique.}
\end{wrapfigure}

This first model of the atom is rudimentary; each element is a unique atom,
and those atoms cannot be subdivided. The atom is modeled as one large, solid,
uniform, and neutral object. British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered that
atoms could be split into a light, negatively charged particle and a heavier,
positively charged particle (we now know this is the nucleus, the dense
grouping of protons and neutrons in the center of an atom).

Suddenly, the atom went from neutral and indivisible to made of different types
of charged particles. Further experiments by Ernest Rutherford showed the atom
to be mainly empty space, further updating scientists' model of the atom.
Subsequently, Bohr explained the phenomena of spectral lines (we will discuss
this further in Sequence 2) by modeling electrons as being restricted to
orbiting specific distances from the nucleus.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=3in]{atomCloud.png}
\caption{}
\label{fig:atomCloud}
\end{wrapfigure}

This is likely the model you are most familiar with seeing, and it is the one we
will use most often in this text. The first figure shown in this chapter is a Bohr
model: it shows the protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and models the electrons 
as moving in discrete orbits around the nucleus. 

However, the Bohr model is slightly inaccurate. While it is a convenient model for
thinking about atoms, in reality, electrons don't neatly orbit the nucleus.
Scientists don't know exactly where an electron will be in relation to the
nucleus, but they do know where it is most likely to be. They use a cloud that is
thicker in the center but fades out at the edges to represent an electron's
position (see figure \ref{fig:atomCloud}).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=3in]{water_polar.png}

\label{fig:water_polar}
\end{wrapfigure}

While the cloud model is more accurate, we will use the Bohr model as it
allows the viewer to easily and quickly assess the number and arrangement of
electrons.

\subsection{Classifying Atoms}

We classify atoms by the numbers of protons they have. An atom with one proton
is a hydrogen atom, an atom with two protons is a helium atom, and so forth
(refer to periodic table on pg..). We say that hydrogen and helium are \textit{
elements} because the classification of elements is based on the proton number.
And we give each element an atomic symbol. Hydrogen gets $H$, helium gets $He$,
oxygen gets $O$, carbon gets $C$\index{elements}, and so on.

\section{Classifying Compounds}
When atoms of different elements combine, they make \textit{compounds}. Compounds 
are substances made up of more than one element. Water is an example of a 
compound: it is made of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded one oxygen atom (see 
figure \ref{fig:water_polar}). The result is a water molecule\index{molecules}. 
The different atoms cluster together because they share electrons in their clouds.
This is the nature of a \textit{covalent bond}\index{covalent bond}: it is formed 
when atoms share electrons. Sometimes, electrons are shared evenly, but in water, 
they are shared unevenly. The electrons are more attracted to the oxygen atoms 
than the hydrogen atoms, so they spend more time on the oxygen atom. As a result, 
the oxygen side of a water molecule has a slight negative charge, while the 
hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. The slight charges are represented 
with a lower case Greek letter delta, $\delta$. This uneven distribution of 
electrons is due to the difference in electronegativity\index{electronegativity} 
between the two elements. Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom 
attracts electrons. We will discuss electronegativity, as well as the properties 
of polar and non-polar molecules, in Sequence 2. 

Another way compounds form is through ionic bonds. If the difference in 
electronegativity between two atoms is large enough, the more electronegative atom
will steal an electron from the less electronegative atom. You can think of this 
as a tug of war over the electron between the atoms: in an ionic bond, one atom is
strong enough to permanently win the tug of war. Another common compound, table 
salt, is an ionic compound. The formula for table salt is $NaCl$. It is made of 
one sodium atom and one chlorine atom. The Bohr models for both are shown in 
figure \ref{fig:Na_Cl_bohr}. 

\begin{figure}
%fixme neutral sodium chlorine bohr models and electron transfer
\label{fig:Na_Cl_bohr}
\end{figure}

When sodium and chlorine are brought together, the chlorine atoms each steal an 
electron from the sodium atoms, making two \textit{ions}\index{ion} (charged 
atoms). The opposite charges of the ions attract each other, resulting in a 
regular stacking of ions that form a crystal (see figure \ref{fig:Na_Cl_lattice}). 
The smallest unit of an ionic compound is a \textit{formula unit}\index{formula unit}.
When sodium and chlorine react, one sodium ion is made for every chlorine ion. 
They react in a 1:1 ratio, so the formula unit is $NaCl$. 

\begin{figure}
%fixme figure crystal lattice model and actual crystal of NaCl
\label{fig:Na_Cl_lattice}
\end{figure}



There are many kinds of compounds. You know a few:
\begin{itemize}
\item Table salt is crystals made of $NaCl$ molecules: a sodium atom attached
to a chlorine atom.
\item Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is $NaHCO_3$.
\item Vinegar is a solution including acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$).
\item $O_2$ is the oxygen molecules that you breathe out of the air (air, a
blend of gases, is mostly $N_2$.).
\end{itemize}

\begin{Exercise}[title = {Numbers of Atoms in Molecules}, label = num_atom]
State the number of atoms of each element and the total number of atoms in one
molecule of the given substance.
\begin{enumerate}
\item methane, $CH_4$
\item copper (II) sulfate, $CuSO_4$
\item glucose, $C_6H_{12}O_6$
\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}[ref = num_atom]
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1 carbon, 4 hydrogens, 5 total atoms
\item 1 copper, 1 sulfur, 4 oxygens, 6 total atoms
\item 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 6 oxygens, 24 total atoms
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

\section{Chemical Reactions}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=3in]{exo_endo_diagrams.png}
\caption{}
\label{fig:exo_endo_diagrams}
\end{wrapfigure}

Sometimes two hydrogen atoms form a molecule ($H_2$). Sometimes two oxygen
atoms form a molecule ($O_2$). If you mix these together and light a match,
they will rearrange themselves into water molecules. This is called a \textit{
chemical reaction}. In any chemical reaction, the atoms are rearranged into new
molecules.\index{chemical reaction}

Some chemical reactions (like the burning of hydrogen gas described above) are
\textit{exothermic} --- that is, they give off energy. Burning hydrogen gas
happens quickly and gives off a lot of energy. If you have enough, it will make
quite an explosion! \index{exothermic}

Other chemical reactions are \textit{endothermic} --- they consume energy.
Photosynthesis, the process by which plants consume energy from the sun to make
sugar from $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ requires an endothermic chemical reaction.\index{endothermic}

Examine the diagrams in figure \ref{fig:exo_endo_diagrams}. The $x$-axis 
represents time - time passes as wemove from left to right across the diagram. 
At the far left, the energy of the reactants (the ingredients that go into the 
reaction) is shown. At the far right, the energy of the products (what is made in 
the chemical reaction) is shown. The red diagrams shows an exothermic reaction: 
the products (what is made) have less energy than the reactants (the "ingredients"
that start the reaction). Since energy is never created or destroyed, where did 
the energy go? It is released as heat. So, exothermic reactions release heat.

Now, look at the endothermic reaction diagram (the blue one). Based on the
relative energies of the reactants and products, do you expect and endothermic
reaction to release or absorb heat? Absorb! Since the products have more
energy, they must have absorbed energy, in the form of heat, from the surroundings.

What does this look and feel like in real life? If an exothermic reaction were
happening in a glass beaker, you would feel warmth if you held the beaker. The
heat is leaving the beaker and entering your hand, which feels warm. What
about an endothermic reaction? Many students think that since an endothermic
reaction absorbs heat, it must be getting hot. This is incorrect:
\textit{exothermic} reactions feel hot. If an endothermic reaction were
happening in a beaker and you touched the beaker, it would feel \textbf{cold}.
Why? Well, if the reaction is absorbing heat, then heat must be leaving it
surroundings (your hand) and entering the reaction (this heat energy is turned
into chemical energy that is stored in the new chemical bonds that are
forming). So your hand feels cold. %fixme: models showing flow of heat in/out of system for chemical reactions.

\section{Mass and Acceleration}

Each atom has a mass, which means everything made up of those atoms has mass as 
well (and that's pretty much everything!). We measure mass in grams. A paper clip 
is about 1 gram of steel. An adult human can have a mass of 70,000 grams, so for 
larger things, we often talk about kilograms, which is 1000 grams.

The first interesting thing about mass is that objects with more mass
require more force to accelerate. For example, pushing a bicycle so
that it accelerates from a standstill to jogging speed in 2 seconds
requires much less force than pushing a train so that it accelerates
at the same rate.


\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Newton's Second Law of Motion}]

The force necessary to accelerate an object of mass $m$ at an acceleration of
$a$ is given by:
$$F = m a$$

This means the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration.

\end{mdframed}

What are the units here? We already know that mass is measured in
kilograms. We can measure velocity in meters per second, but that is
different from acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change in
velocity. So if we want to go from 0 to 5 meters per second (that's
jogging speed) in two seconds, that is a change in velocity of 2.5
meters per second every second. We would say this acceleration is $2.5
m/s^2$.

\subsection{Calculating Acceleration}
As suggested above, acceleration is a change in velocity. It is calculated by
dividing the change in velocity by the time it takes to make that change.

\begin{mdframed}[style = important, frametitle = {Calculating Acceleration}]
The acceleration of an object from an initial velocity, $v_i$, to a final
velocity, $v_f$, over a period of time, $t$, is given by:

$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}$$
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Example}: Your car can go from zero to 60 mph in 3 seconds. What is the
acceleration in $m / s^2$?

\textbf{Solution}: First, let's convert from the imperial units of miles per
hour to the SI units of meters per second. You can do this using a search engine, 
but we will show how to do it by hand below. (You will learn more about this 
method in the Units chapter).

$$\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \cdot \frac{1.61 \text{ km}}{1 
\text{ mile}} \cdot \frac{1000\text{ m}}{1\text{ km}} \cdot \frac{1\text{ hour}}{
3600\text{ seconds}} \approx \frac{26.82\text{ m}}{s}$$

Now we have the starting velocity (0 m/s), the ending velocity (26.82 m/s), and 
the time (3 s), and we can find the acceleration:
$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{26.82\frac{m}{s} - 0\frac{m}{s}}{3s} \approx 
8.94 \frac{m}{s^2}$$

\subsection{Determining Force}
What about measuring force? Newton decided to name the unit after himself: The
force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at $1 m/s^2$ is known as \textit{a
newton}. It is often denoted by the symbol $N$.

$$1 N = 1 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}$$

\textbf{Example}: If the car in the above example has a mass of 1500 kg, how much 
force does the engine use to accelerate the car?

\textbf{Solution}: We have already found the car's acceleration: 8.94 $m/s^2$. 
With the mass and acceleration, we can use Newton's Second Law to find the force 
needed to accelerate the car:
$$F = m \cdot a = 1500\text{ kg} \cdot 8.94 \frac{m}{s^2} = 13410\text{ N}$$

\begin{Exercise}[title={Acceleration}, label=acceleration_train]

While driving a bulldozer, you come across a train car (with no brakes
and no locomotive) sitting on a track in the middle of a city. The train car
has a label telling you that it has a mass of 2,400 kg. There is a time-bomb
welded to the interior of the train car, and the timer tells you that
you can safely push the train car for 120 seconds. To get the train
car to where it can explode safely, you need to accelerate it to 20 meters per
second. Fortunately, the track is level and the train car's wheels have
almost no rolling resistance.

With what force, in newtons, do you need to push the train for those 120 seconds?

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=acceleration_train]
If you accelerate to 20 m/s in 120 s, the acceleration is:
$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{20\text{ m/s} - 0\text{ m/s}}{120\text{ s}} = 
\frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s^2}$$

To achieve this acceleration, you will need to apply a force of:
$$F = m \cdot a = 2400\text{ kg} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s^2} = 400\text{ }N$$
\end{Answer}

\section{Mass and Gravity}

The second interesting thing about mass is that masses are
attracted to each other by the force we call \textit{gravity}. The
force of attraction between two objects is proportional to the product
of their masses, and inversely proportional to their distance squared.
This means that as objects get farther away, the force decreases.
This is why you are more attracted to the earth than you are to
distant stars, even though they have much more mass than the earth.
%ADD: Collums Law

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}]

Two masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) that are a distance of
$r$ from each other are attracted toward each other with a force of
magnitude:

$$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. If you measure the
mass in kilograms and the distance in meters, $G$ is about $6.674
\times 10^{-11}$. That will get you the force of the attraction in
newtons.

\end{mdframed}

\begin{Exercise}[title={Gravity}, label=gravity_earth]

  The earth's mass is about $6 \times 10^{24}$ kilograms.

  Your spacecraft's mass is 6,800 kilograms.

  Your spacecraft is also about 100,000 km from the center of the earth. (For 
  reference, the moon is about 400,000 km from the center of the earth.)

  What is the force of gravity that is pulling your spacecraft and the earth 
  toward each other?

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=gravity_earth]

  $$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11})\frac{(6.8 \time 10^3)(6 
  \times 10^{24})}{(10^5)^2} = 6.1 \times 10^{6}$$

  About 6 million newtons.

\end{Answer}

\section{Mass and Weight}

Gravity pulls on things proportional to their mass, so we often
ignore the difference between mass and weight.

The weight of an object is the force due to the object's mass and
gravity. When we say, ``This potato weighs 1 pound,'' we actually mean
``This potato weighs 1 pound on earth.'' That same potato would weigh
about one-fifth of a pound on the moon (see figure \ref{fig:massvweight}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{massvweight.png}
\caption{Mass is a measure of all the matter in an object. Weight is a measure of 
the force of gravity on that object. Mass is not location-dependent, while weight 
is.}
\label{fig:massvweight}
\end{figure}

However, that potato has a mass of 0.45 kg no matter where it is in the universe.

%FIXME Global layout note: Let's discuss adding Title's and Captions to all graphics.\\

%For example:\\
%TITLE: Mass versus Weight\\
%CAPTION: Human Earth weight: 150lbs / Moon weight:??lbs\\
%Potato Earth weight: .25lbs / Moon weight: ??lbs \\

%FIXME:
%Allison thinks it would be funny if the person in the graphic were holding a potato and we also added the weight and mass of the potato to the caption. No worries if this type of edit isn't in the budget!

%FIXME: What are your thoughts about using the metric system consistently -- in which case we'll replace pounds here with kilos. Max notes: we should explicitly use kilos for mass and pounds or newtons for weight. Kilos are a scalar measure of the amount of matter and pounds are a vector force of gravity on a particular piece of matter. Many students struggle to differentiate between mass and weight at a theoretical level due to casual comparison between pounds and kilos.
