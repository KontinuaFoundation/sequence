All things (including the air around you) are made of atoms. Atoms are
incredibly tiny --- there are more atoms in a drop of water than there are
drops of water in all the oceans.
% ADD: If you want a better visual of the scale: https://htwins.net/scale2/, start at around 10^-8

Every atom has a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons. Orbiting around the
nucleus is a cloud of electrons. However, the mass of the atom
comes mainly from the protons and neutrons, since they are about 2000 times as
massive as an electron! These three particles, protons, neutrons, and
electrons, are called \textit{subatomic particles}.\index{protons} \index{neutrons}

\subsection{Models of the Atom}
Over the history of science, there have been many ideas about the structure of
atoms. This history is a good example of how science develops: unexpected
results drive scientists to update their models, moving us closer and closer to
a true model of the atom.

During his investigations into the behavior of gases,
John Dalton noted that different elements combine in strict
ratios. For example, he noted that nitrogen and oxygen combine in a 1:1 and 1:2
fashion, but no ratio in between.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=3in]{daltons_model.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

This first model of the atom is rudimentary; each element is a unique atom,
and those atoms cannot be subdivided. The atom is modeled as one large, solid,
uniform, and neutral object. British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered that
atoms could be split into a light, negatively charged particle and a heavier,
positively charged particle (we now know this is the nucleus, the dense
grouping of protons and neutrons in the center of an atom).

Suddenly, the atom went from neutral and indivisible to made of different types
of charged particles. Further experiments by Ernest Rutherford showed the atom
to be mainly empty space, further updating scientists' model of the atom.
Subsequently, Bohr explained the phenomena of spectral lines (we will discuss
this further in Sequence 2) by modeling electrons as being restricted to
orbiting specific distances from the nucleus.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{3in}
\noindent\includegraphics[width=3in]{atomCloud.png}
\end{wrapfigure}

This is likely the model you are most familiar with seeing, and it is the one we
will use most often in this text.

However, the Bohr model is slightly inaccurate. While it is a convenient model for
thinking about atoms, in reality, electrons don't neatly orbit the nucleus.
Scientists don't know exactly where an electron will be in relation to the
nucleus, but they do know where it is most likely to be. They use a cloud that is
thicker in the center but fades out at the edges to represent an electron's
position.

While the cloud model is more accurate, we will use the Bohr model as it
allows the viewer to easily and quickly assess the number and arrangement of
electrons.

\subsubsection{Classifying Atoms}

We classify atoms by the numbers of protons they have. An atom with one proton
is a hydrogen atom, an atom with two protons is a helium atom, and so forth
(refer to periodic table on pg..). We say that hydrogen and helium are \textit{
elements} because the classification of elements is based on the proton number.
And we give each element an atomic symbol. Hydrogen gets $H$, helium gets $He$,
oxygen gets $O$, carbon gets $C$\index{elements}, and so on.

Often, two hydrogen atoms will attach to an oxygen atom. The result is
a water molecule\index{molecules}. Why do they cluster together? Because they
share electrons in their clouds. Sometimes, electrons are shared evenly, but in
water, they are shared unevenly. The electrons are more attracted to the oxygen
atoms than the hydrogen atoms, so they spend more time on the oxygen atom. As a
result, the oxygen side of a water molecule has a slight negative charge, while
the hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This is due to the different
in electronegativity\index{electronegativity} between the two elements. The
slight charges are represented with a lower case Greek letter delta, $\delta$.
Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts electrons, and
will be discussed further in Sequence 2.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{water_polar.png}
\end{center}

A molecule is described by the elements it contains. Water is $H_2O$
because it has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The subscript describes
the number of atoms of the element immediately preceding the subscript.

There are many kinds of molecules. You know a few:
\begin{itemize}
\item Table salt is crystals made of $NaCl$ molecules: a sodium atom attached
to a chlorine atom.
\item Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is $NaHCO_3$.
\item Vinegar is a solution including acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$).
\item $O_2$ is the oxygen molecules that you breathe out of the air (air, a
blend of gases, is mostly $N_2$.).
\end{itemize}

\begin{Exercise}[title = {Numbers of Atoms in Molecules}, label = num_atom]

\end{enumerate}
\end{Exercise}

\item 1 carbon, 4 hydrogens, 5 total atoms
\item 1 copper, 1 sulfur, 4 oxygens, 6 total atoms
\item 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, 6 oxygens, 24 total atoms
\end{enumerate}
\end{Answer}

\subsection{Reading the Periodic Table}
The Periodic Table organizes what we know about the structure of different
elements. Each element has its own block or tile on the Periodic Table, and the
information on the tile tells us about the structure of that atom. Take a look at
the tile for carbon:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{carbon_tile.png}
\end{center}

The letter (or letters, as is the case for other elements) is the atomic symbol
for the element. There are two key numbers: the atomic number and the average
atomic mass. For carbon, the atomic number is 6 and the average atomic mass is
12.011. The atomic number tells us how many protons there are in the nucleus of
any atom of carbon. Since every element has a unique number of protons, every
element has a unique atomic number. All carbon atoms have 6 protons. The other
number is the average atomic mass - it tells us the weighted average of the
mass of all the carbons in the universe. When the average atomic mass is in
a whole number, as it is for polonium, it means that the element is very unstable.
As a result, the mass given is the mass of the most stable isotope (we'll talk
more about stability and isotopes below). On some periodic tables, the mass
number of the most stable isotope will be in parentheses or brackets. In
summary, if the larger number is a whole number, it is the mass number; if it
is a decimal (even if the decimal ends in .00), it is the average atomic mass,
which we will discuss further below.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{polonium_tile.png}
\end{center}

The Royal Society of Chemistry has a very useful interactive periodic table:
periodic-table.rsc.org. We can use the periodic tile for an element to
determine the number of protons, electrons, and most common number of neutrons
for a neutral atom of that element (we'll explain why the periodic tile tells
us the "most common number of neutrons" below).

\textbf{Example}: State the atomic symbol for and the number of protons,
neutrons, and electrons in a neutral atom of plutonium.

\textbf{Solution}: The plutonium tile on your periodic table should look
something like this:
\begin{center}
   \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[black, thick] (-1.5, -1.5) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
        \node[font = \Huge] at (0,0.15) {Pu};
        \node[] at (-1.25, 1.25) {$94$};
        \node[] at (0, -0.55) {Plutonium};
        \node[] at (0, -1.25) {$(244)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

[The information may be arranged differently, but you should at least see the
symbol and two numbers.] As you can see, the atomic symbol for plutonium is Pu.
Since its atomic number is 94, we know every atom of plutonium has 94 protons.
To know the number of electrons, we will take advantage of the fact that the
question is asking about a \textit{neutral} atom. This means there are the same
number of positive charges as negative charges. So, since there are 94 protons,
a neutral atom of plutonium must have 94 electrons (each proton has a +1 charge
and each electron has a -1 charge). Lastly, let's determine the number of
neutrons. The other number, 244, is the mass number. It represents the total
number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Since we know plutonium has 94
protons, we can find the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number
from the mass number:

\begin{center}
   \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node[font = \LARGE] at (0,0) {$244 - 94 = 150$};
        \node[font = \small, red] at (-2.5, -0.75) {\textbf{mass number}};
        \node[font = \tiny, red] at (-2.5, -1) {\textbf{protons + neutrons}};
        \draw[red, -latex] (-2.5, -0.6) -- (-1.85, -0.25);
        \node[font = \small, blue] at (0, -1.25) {\textbf{atomic number}};
        \node[font = \tiny, blue] at (0, -1.5) {\textbf{protons}};
        \draw[blue, -latex] (0, -1.15) -- (0, -0.25);
        \node[font = \small, violet] at (2.5, -0.75) {\textbf{number of neutrons}};
        \draw[violet, -latex] (2.5, -0.6) -- (1.85, -0.25);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Therefore, an atom of plutonium has 150 neutrons. Now let's address how to find
the number of neutrons when the periodic tile shows an average atomic mass,
instead of a mass number. This occurs when there is more than one "version" of
an element. In the case of plutonium, there is only one version, which is why
the periodic tile shows a mass number instead of an average atomic mass. To
learn about average atomic mass, we will use carbon as an example.

Have you heard of carbon-14 dating? The phrase "carbon-14" refers to a rare
type of carbon that decays radioactively. By seeing how much carbon-14 has
decayed, scientists can estimate the age of organic materials, such as bone or
ash. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope (or version) of carbon. The 14 refers to
the mass number - the total amount of protons and neutrons in the nucleus
(sometimes, we shorten the isotope name by just using the atomic symbol, in
this case C-14). Isotopes are versions of an element with different numbers of
neutrons. The atomic number is the same for them all - they all have the same
number of protons. But the different number of neutrons causes different
isotopes to have different masses. Examine the models of carbon-12, carbon-13,
and carbon-14 below. What is different between them? What is the same?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{carbon_iso.png}
\end{center}

You should have noticed that all three atoms have 6 protons and 6 electrons,
while they have differing numbers of neutrons. The most common isotope of carbon
is carbon-12, with 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its nucleus. Carbon-14, on the
other hand, has 8 neutrons, which makes the nucleus unstable, leading to
radioactive decay. The average atomic mass
is the weighted average of all the carbon atoms in existence. Since the vast
majority of carbon is carbon-12, the average atomic mass is very close to 12.
You cannot determine the mass number of an individual atom from the periodic
table; it only tells you the average of all the isotopes. However, especially
for light atoms (atoms in the first two rows of the periodic table), you can
usually determine the mass number of the most common isotope by rounding the
average atomic mass to the nearest whole number.

\textbf{Example}: Germanium has atomic symbol Ge. State the number of protons,
number of electrons, and most common number of neutrons in a neutral atom of
germanium.

\textbf{Solution}: Examining the periodic table, we see that germanium has an
atomic number of 32, which means a neutral atom of germanium has 32 protons and
32 electrons. The average atomic mass is 72.630, which rounds up to 73. So, the
most common isotope of germanium is Ge-73, which has $73 - 32 = 41$ neutrons.

\section{Chemical Reaction}

Sometimes two hydrogen atoms form a molecule ($H_2$). Sometimes two oxygen
atoms form a molecule ($O_2$). If you mix these together and light a match,
they will rearrange themselves into water molecules. This is called a \textit{
chemical reaction}. In any chemical reaction, the atoms are rearranged into new
molecules.\index{chemical reaction}

Some chemical reactions (like the burning of hydrogen gas described above) are
\textit{exothermic} --- that is, they give off energy. Burning hydrogen gas
happens quickly and gives off a lot of energy. If you have enough, it will make
quite an explosion! \index{exothermic}

Other chemical reactions are \textit{endothermic} --- they consume energy.
Photosynthesis, the process by which plants consume energy from the sun to make
sugar from $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ requires an endothermic chemical reaction.\index{endothermic}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{exo_endo_diagrams.png}
\end{center}

Let's examine these diagrams. The $x$-axis represents time - time passes as we
move from left to right across the diagram. At the far left, the energy of the
reactants (the ingredients that go into the reaction) is shown. At the far
right, the energy of the products (what is made in the chemical reaction) is
shown. The red diagrams shows an exothermic reaction: the products (what is
made) have less energy than the reactants (the "ingredients" that start the
reaction). Since energy is never created or destroyed, where did the energy go?
It is released as heat. So, exothermic reactions release heat.

Now, look at the endothermic reaction diagram (the blue one). Based on the
relative energies of the reactants and products, do you expect and endothermic
reaction to release or absorb heat? Absorb! Since the products have more
energy, they must have absorbed energy, in the form of heat, from the surroundings.

What does this look and feel like in real life? If an exothermic reaction were
happening in a glass beaker, you would feel warmth if you held the beaker. The
heat is leaving the beaker and entering your hand, which feels warm. What
about an endothermic reaction? Many students think that since an endothermic
reaction absorbs heat, it must be getting hot. This is incorrect:
\textit{exothermic} reactions feel hot. If an endothermic reaction were
happening in a beaker and you touched the beaker, it would feel \textbf{cold}.
Why? Well, if the reaction is absorbing heat, then heat must be leaving it
surroundings (your hand) and entering the reaction (this heat energy is turned
into chemical energy that is stored in the new chemical bonds that are
forming). So your hand feels cold. %fixme: models showing flow of heat in/out of system for chemical reactions.

\section{Mass and Acceleration}

Each atom has a mass, which means everything made up of those atoms has mass as well (and that's pretty much everything!). We measure mass in grams. A
paper clip is about 1 gram of steel. An adult human can have a mass of 70,000
grams, so for larger things, we often talk about kilograms, which
is 1000 grams.

The first interesting thing about mass is that objects with more mass
require more force to accelerate. For example, pushing a bicycle so
that it accelerates from a standstill to jogging speed in 2 seconds
requires much less force than pushing a train so that it accelerates
at the same rate.


\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Newton's Second Law of Motion}]

The force necessary to accelerate an object of mass $m$ at an acceleration of
$a$ is given by:
$$F = m a$$

This means the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration.

\end{mdframed}

What are the units here? We already know that mass is measured in
kilograms. We can measure velocity in meters per second, but that is
different from acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change in
velocity. So if we want to go from 0 to 5 meters per second (that's
jogging speed) in two seconds, that is a change in velocity of 2.5
meters per second every second. We would say this acceleration is $2.5
m/s^2$.

\subsection{Calculating Acceleration}
As suggested above, acceleration is a change in velocity. It is calculated by
dividing the change in velocity by the time it takes to make that change.

\begin{mdframed}[style = important, frametitle = {Calculating Acceleration}]
The acceleration of an object from an initial velocity, $v_i$, to a final
velocity, $v_f$, over a period of time, $t$, is given by:

$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t}$$
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Example}: Your car can go from zero to 60 mph in 3 seconds. What is the
acceleration in $m / s^2$?

\textbf{Solution}: First, let's convert from the imperial units of miles per
hour to the SI units of meters per second. You can do this using a search engine, but we will show how to do it by hand below. (You will learn more about this method in the Units chapter).

$$\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} \cdot \frac{1.61 \text{ km}}{1 \text{ mile}} \cdot \frac{1000\text{ m}}{1\text{ km}} \cdot \frac{1\text{ hour}}{3600\text{ seconds}} \approx \frac{26.82\text{ m}}{s}$$

Now we have the starting velocity (0 m/s), the ending velocity (26.82 m/s), and the time (3 s), and we can find the acceleration:
$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{26.82\frac{m}{s} - 0\frac{m}{s}}{3s} \approx 8.94 \frac{m}{s^2}$$

\subsection{Determining Force}
What about measuring force? Newton decided to name the unit after himself: The
force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at $1 m/s^2$ is known as \textit{a
newton}. It is often denoted by the symbol $N$.

$$1 N = 1 \frac{kg \cdot m}{s^2}$$

\textbf{Example}: If the car in the above example has a mass of 1500 kg, how much force does the engine use to accelerate the car?

\textbf{Solution}: We have already found the car's acceleration: 8.94 $m/s^2$. With the mass and acceleration, we can use Newton's Second Law to find the force needed to accelerate the car:
$$F = m \cdot a = 1500\text{ kg} \cdot 8.94 \frac{m}{s^2} = 13410\text{ N}$$

\begin{Exercise}[title={Acceleration}, label=acceleration_train]

While driving a bulldozer, you come across a train car (with no brakes
and no locomotive) sitting on a track in the middle of a city. The train car
has a label telling you that it has a mass of 2,400 kg. There is a timebomb
welded to the interior of the train car, and the timer tells you that
you can safely push the train car for 120 seconds. To get the train
car to where it can explode safely, you need to accelerate it to 20 meters per
second. Fortunately, the track is level and the train car's wheels have
almost no rolling resistance.

With what force, in newtons, do you need to push the train for those 120 seconds?

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=acceleration_train]
If you accelerate to 20 m/s in 120 s, the acceleration is:
$$a = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t} = \frac{20\text{ m/s} - 0\text{ m/s}}{120\text{ s}} = \frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s^2}$$

To achieve this acceleration, you will need to apply a force of:
$$F = m \cdot a = 2400\text{ kg} \cdot \frac{1}{6} \frac{m}{s^2} = 400\text{ }N$$
\end{Answer}

\section{Mass and Gravity}

The second interesting thing about mass is that masses are
attracted to each other by the force we call \textit{gravity}. The
force of attraction between two objects is proportional to the product
of their masses, and inversely proportional to their distance squared.
This means that as objects get farther away, the force decreases.
This is why you are more attracted to the earth than you are to
distant stars, even though they have much more mass than the earth.
%ADD: Collums Law

\begin{mdframed}[style=important, frametitle={Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation}]

Two masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) that are a distance of
$r$ from each other are attracted toward each other with a force of
magnitude:

$$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$

where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. If you measure the
mass in kilograms and the distance in meters, $G$ is about $6.674
\times 10^{-11}$. That will get you the force of the attraction in
newtons.

\end{mdframed}

\begin{Exercise}[title={Gravity}, label=gravity_earth]

  The earth's mass is about $6 \times 10^{24}$ kilograms.

  Your spacecraft's mass is 6,800 kilograms.

  Your spacecraft is also about 100,000 km from the center of the earth. (For reference, the moon is about 400,000 km from the center of the earth.)

  What is the force of gravity that is pulling your spacecraft and the earth toward each other?

\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}[ref=gravity_earth]

  $$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11})\frac{(6.8 \time 10^3)(6 \times 10^{24})}{(10^5)^2} = 6.1 \times 10^{6}$$

  About 6 million newtons.

\end{Answer}

\section{Mass and Weight}

Gravity pulls on things proportional to their mass, so we often
ignore the difference between mass and weight.

The weight of an object is the force due to the object's mass and
gravity. When we say, ``This potato weighs 1 pound,'' we actually mean
``This potato weighs 1 pound on earth.'' That same potato would weigh
about one-fifth of a pound on the moon.

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{massvweight.png}

However, that potato has a mass of 0.45 kg no matter where it is in the universe.

%FIXME Global layout note: Let's discuss adding Title's and Captions to all graphics.\\

%For example:\\
%TITLE: Mass versus Weight\\
%CAPTION: Human Earth weight: 150lbs / Moon weight:??lbs\\
%Potato Earth weight: .25lbs / Moon weight: ??lbs \\

%FIXME:
%Allison thinks it would be funny if the person in the graphic were holding a potato and we also added the weight and mass of the potato to the caption. No worries if this type of edit isn't in the budget!

%FIXME: What are your thoughts about using the metric system consistently -- in which case we'll replace pounds here with kilos. Max notes: we should explicitly use kilos for mass and pounds or newtons for weight. Kilos are a scalar measure of the amount of matter and pounds are a vector force of gravity on a particular piece of matter. Many students struggle to differentiate between mass and weight at a theoretical level due to casual comparison between pounds and kilos.
